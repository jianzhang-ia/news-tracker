      "body": "* \u20ac5.2bn in EU ETS revenues channelled into three new 2025 Innovation Fund programmes\n\n* \u20ac2.9bn for net-zero technologies, \u20ac1.3bn for clean hydrogen auctions, \u20ac1bn for industrial process heat\n\n* Additional \u20ac1.765bn in national co-funding from Germany and Spain for hydrogen and industrial heat projects\n\nBrussels opens the next round of large scale climate-technology funding with a \u20ac5.2bn ($5.6 Billion) package drawn from EU Emissions Trading System revenues, creating parallel pipelines for industrial heat decarbonization, renewable hydrogen and the expansion of net-zero manufacturing across the bloc.\n\nThe European Commission confirmed three separate 2025 calls under the Innovation Fund: a \u20ac2.9bn Net-Zero Technologies programme, a \u20ac1.3bn hydrogen auction under the European Hydrogen Bank, and a \u20ac1bn auction dedicated to industrial process heat. The package sits within Europe's wider clean industrial strategy aimed at meeting 2030 climate targets and reaching net zero by 2050, while deepening domestic competitiveness in a global race for low carbon manufacturing capacity.\n\nThe \u20ac2.9bn Net-Zero Technologies call targets projects capable of cutting greenhouse gas emissions at industrial scale while demonstrating commercially viable innovation. Eligible proposals include battery manufacturing, heat pumps, hydrogen technologies, energy storage and component manufacturing for renewable energy deployment.\n\nProjects will be assessed on emission-reduction potential, technological maturity, replicability, innovation and cost efficiency. The Commission has added an additional scoring incentive for SME-led projects, recognising the role of smaller firms in commercialising early-stage decarbonisation solutions.\n\nThe programme is designed to attract both public and private investment into domestic clean-tech supply chains at a time when capital competition from the United States and Asia remains intense. Strategic intent is clear: narrow the financing gap for industrial-scale climate technologies and keep core manufacturing capacity within the European market.\n\nHydrogen sits at the centre of Europe's heavy industry decarbonisation plan. The third European Hydrogen Bank auction introduces three categories, including a new track for producers supplying maritime or aviation offtakers. The \u20ac1.3bn pool will support renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and electrolytic low-carbon hydrogen, paying a fixed premium for verified production for up to ten years.\n\nFor investors, the structure presents predictable revenue streams and price confidence during the scale-up phase of electrolysis infrastructure. For policymakers, the auction model creates a competitive route to market while pushing deployment into hard-to-abate sectors where emissions reductions are most costly but most valuable.\n\nThe \u20ac1bn industrial heat auction launches the first phase of what the Commission calls an Industrial Decarbonisation Bank. Industrial heat accounts for roughly three quarters of EU industrial emissions, making electrification and direct-renewable heat essential to long term competitiveness.\n\nProjects may deploy electric boilers, heat pumps, induction heating, resistance heating, geothermal systems, solar thermal or hybrid configurations. Funding will be awarded to the most cost-effective CO2 abatement proposals, with payments made as output-based fixed premiums for up to five years.\n\nBy treating heat as a competitive market mechanism, the Commission aims to close the cost gap between renewable solutions and fossil inputs, creating a scalable benchmark for future auctions in steel, chemicals, cement and food processing.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: EU Allocates \u20ac422M to Expand Alternative Fuels Infrastructure, Boost Zero-Emission Mobility\n\nTo absorb oversubscription and accelerate scale, Member States will be able to finance eligible but unfunded projects through an Auctions-as-a-Service model. Germany has already committed \u20ac1.3bn in additional national funding for RFNBO hydrogen projects. Spain will provide \u20ac465mn, including \u20ac415mn for hydrogen and \u20ac50mn for industrial heat decarbonisation.\n\nThis blended funding structure creates a deep pipeline of investable assets while accelerating standardization in project evaluation and state-aid approvals.\n\nApplications for the Net-Zero Technologies call close 23 April 2026, with grant agreements expected in early 2027. Bidders for the hydrogen and heat auctions have until 19 February 2026, with agreements anticipated within nine months of closure. The Commission will host information days in December 2025 to support applicants.\n\nFor C-suite leaders and institutional investors, the \u20ac5.2bn package represents one of Europe's most concentrated near-term deployment commitments. It offers revenue-stabilised entry points into hydrogen, industrial heat and manufacturing supply chains, all designed to accelerate emissions reductions in the most carbon-intensive parts of the economy.\n\nThe outcome will shape Europe's industrial competitiveness in the coming decade. If projects deliver at scale, the continent moves closer to a self-sustaining decarbonisation economy. If deployment stalls, global leadership in clean manufacturing may continue shifting toward markets with faster permitting and deeper capital incentives.\n\nThe auctions now move into the market. The technology, and the pace of investment that follows, will determine how much of Europe's industrial future is built on low carbon foundations.",

      "body": "The European Commission has announced the opening of three new funding opportunities under the Innovation Fund with a total budget of \u20ac5.2 billion in EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) revenues . The 2025 Net-Zero Technologies call with a budget of \u20ac2.9 billion, the third auction for hydrogen production under the European Hydrogen Bank with \u20ac1.3 billion, and the first-ever auction for decarbonisation of industrial process heat under the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank with a \u20ac1 billion budget.\n\nTogether, these opportunities mark a major step forward in achieving the EU's climate and energy objectives by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. They will also significantly contribute to progress on the clean transition and deliver the Clean Industrial Deal , boosting the competitiveness and resilience of European industry.\n\nDriving Europe's clean industrial transformation\n\nThe general call for net-zero technologies (IF25 NZT call) seeks to bridge investment gaps, attract public and private capital, and strengthen Europe's leadership in clean-technology manufacturing and deployment.\n\nWith an allocated budget of \u20ac2.9 billion, it supports decarbonisation projects that demonstrate highly innovative technologies and processes that are sufficiently mature and have a significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It involves projects of different scale, as well as those focusing on the manufacturing of components for renewable energy, energy storage, heat pumps and hydrogen production, including electric-vehicle batteries.\n\nProjects that can apply to the call will be assessed based on their potential to reduce GHG emissions, degree of innovation, project maturity, replicability and cost efficiency. Recognising that small-scale innovations can play an important role in Europe's decarbonisation efforts, there will be a new dedicated bonus point for projects coordinated and implemented only by SMEs.\n\nSupporting industrial transformation through hydrogen\n\nClean hydrogen is an important alternative to replace fossil fuels, and it is increasingly used for the decarbonisation of heavy industry and transport sectors. With \u20ac1.3 billion, the third auction under the European Hydrogen Bank (IF25 Hydrogen Auction) is designed to provide cost-efficient support for the production of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) hydrogen or electrolytic low-carbon hydrogen across three topics, including a new topic for producers of hydrogen with maritime or aviation off takers.\n\nProjects selected under the auction will receive support in the form of a fixed premium payment upon verified and certified production of hydrogen for a maximum period of 10 years.\n\nTackling emissions with decarbonising industrial process heat\n\nThe first European-wide auction for decarbonising industrial process heat (IF25 Heat Auction) is a milestone in establishing the future Industrial Decarbonisation Bank to address one of the EU's biggest sources of GHG emissions. Up to \u20ac1 billion will be used to support electrified and direct-renewable heat production, which is currently responsible for three-quarters of industrial emissions. Support will be auctioned to projects which can deliver the most cost-effective CO2 abatement, closing the cost gap between sustainable solutions and fossil fuel-based alternatives for industrial process heat.\n\nOpened to different project sizes and across all industrial sectors, the auction will support the deployment of technologies such as heat pumps, electric boilers, resistance and induction heating, direct renewable heat solutions (solar thermal or geothermal) as well as hybrid projects that combine different technologies. Support is granted as an output-based fixed premium, linked to verified decarbonised heat production and paid for a maximum period of five years.\n\nIn addition, Member States have the possibility to leverage on the Innovation Fund's evaluation process and a streamlined state aid approval process. Via the 'Auctions-as-a-Service' scheme , they are able to dedicate national funds to support projects that have passed the evaluation award criteria but were not selected for Innovation Fund funding due to budgetary limitations. Germany and Spain have confirmed their participation in Auctions-as-a-Service in these auctions. Germany will dedicate a further \u20ac1.3 billion in national funds to support RFNBO hydrogen production projects nationally. Spain will also dedicate a total of \u20ac465 million in national funds, of which \u20ac415 million will support hydrogen projects and an additional \u20ac50 million to support industrial heat decarbonisation projects.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe IF25 NZT call is open for applications until 23 April 2026, 17:00 (CET), via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal . Applicants are strongly encouraged to attend the Info Day which will take place on 16 December. Successful applicants are expected to sign grant agreements by the first quarter of 2027.\n\nFor the IF25 Hydrogen Auction and IF25 Heat Auction, bidders have until 19 February 2026, 17:00 (CET) to apply via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal . Info Days for both auctions will take place on 10 December 2025. Successful bidders are expected to sign grant agreements within nine months after the call closure.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Innovation Fund is one of the world's largest funding programmes for the demonstration and commercialisation of innovative low-carbon technologies, financed by revenues from the EU ETS. With an estimated budget of around \u20ac40 billion between 2020 and 2030), the Fund aims to create financial incentives for companies and public authorities to invest in cutting-edge low-carbon technologies and support Europe's transition to climate neutrality.\n\nCounting all ongoing projects and those under grant agreement preparation, the Innovation Fund has currently awarded over \u20ac15.8 billion in support to more than 275 projects through its previous calls for proposals . Both Hydrogen and Heat auctions use a competitive, market-based approach and follow a pay-as-bid model. Bids are ranked by price within each topic and are awarded until the available budget is allocated. For the hydrogen auction, bids are ranked by price in euro per kilogram of hydrogen produced; for the heat auction, by price in euro per tonne of CO2 abated.\n\nUnder the auctions, Project Development Assistance (PDA) remains available for projects wanting to improve their maturity through high-quality technical and financial advisory support provided by the European Investment Bank. Furthermore, the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) Seal will be awarded to projects that meet all evaluation criteria, including both those that are selected for funding and those that are not due to budgetary limitations. The Seal aims to facilitate high-quality projects access to additional public and private funding.\n\n/Public Release.

      "body": "The European Commission has announced the 2025 Innovation Fund call, opening on beginning on 3 December. Discover the funding opportunities and how Luxinnovation can support you.\n\nThe European Commission opens the next Innovation Fund (IF25) grant call and auctions this 3 December 2025, with a total budget of \u20ac5 billion to accelerate Europe's transition to a net-zero economy. This new call offers major opportunities for companies developing breakthrough technologies that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLaunched in 2020, the EU Innovation Fund is one of the world's largest funding programmes for the deployment of innovative low-carbon technologies. With an estimated total budget of \u20ac40 billion, financed through the EU Emissions Trading System, it supports highly innovative projects in sectors such as Energy-intensive industries (steel, cement, aluminium, pulp and paper), renewable energy, energy storage, carbon (capture, utilisation and storage), clean mobility and net-zero emission buildings.\n\nProjects must involve a minimum CAPEX of \u20ac2.5 million and demonstrate a strong potential for GHG emissions reduction. Project location must be in EU or EEA countries. Funding is generated through the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) and cumulation with national funding is possible.\n\nWhat's in the 2025 Call?\n\nThe IF25 programme includes both grants and competitive auctions:\n\n* Net-zero technologies grant call - \u20ac2.9 billion across five topics\n\n* RNFBO (renewable fuel of non-biological origin) or electrolytic low carbon hydrogen (competitive bidding) - \u20ac1.1 billion across three topics\n\n* Decarbonation of the industrial process heat auction (competitive bidding) - \u20ac1 billion across three topics\n\nFor grant calls, proposals will be evaluated based on: degree of innovation, GHG emissions avoidance, maturity (technical, financial and operational), replicability and cost efficiency.\n\nFor auctions, eligible bids will be ranked by price.\n\nAll call documents are available on the EU Funding & Tenders Portal.\n\nUpcoming Information Events\n\nThe European Commission will organise three online information days:\n\nFor its part, Luxinnovation will hold a National Infoday on 29 January 2026, providing guidance on the call, the award criteria and best practices for preparing a strong application.\n\nBack-to-back with the National Infoday, applicants may also request Orientation Dialogues -- bilateral meetings with the European Commission and the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) to discuss project ideas.\n\nLuxinnovation, your National contact point\n\nAs Luxembourg National contact point for the Innovation Fund, Luxinnovation provides:\n\n* Early-stage guidance\n\n* Continuous assistance throughout proposal development\n\n* Answers to questions\n\n* Proposal reviews, including the annexes\n\nThis support contributed to Luxembourg's first winning project, ECHO-WAVE (\"Energy Community for Hydrogen On-site Production from Wind and AgriVoltaics for Industry DEcarbonisation\"), which secured nearly \u20ac13 million to produce renewable hydrogen in Kehlen.\n\nECHO-WAVE is coordinated by the Luxembourg company GPSS (Green Power Storage Solutions) and also includes the participation of two other companies: Soler and H2 Energiewiss Kielen. The project receives precisely EU funding of \u20ac13 millions, which complements the national support provided by the Ministry of the Economy through the project's successful participation in the national pilot call for green hydrogen production.\n\nECHO-WAVE will provide a wind turbine and an agrivoltaics solar plant, with the electrolyser directly connected to supply the necessary renewable electricity. An expected amount of 2,900 tonnes of renewable hydrogen will be produced during the first ten years of operation. The annual production volume of renewable hydrogen corresponding to more than 60% of Luxembourg's current hydrogen demand.\n\nLuxinnovation supported the project from the beginning. \"First, we held initial meetings with GPSS prior the call launch and advised on how to get started\", explains Sanna Alaranta, Senior Advisor - European R&D and Innovation Support at Luxinnovation. Then we supported by finding answers through out the application process and during Grant Agreement Preparation phase. Finally, prior to submission, we reviewed the draft proposal, including technical description and feasibility study. This successful participation in the highly competitive Innovation Fund represents an outstanding achievement for Luxembourg and the Greater Region\".",

  "executive_brief": "The European Commission has announced \u20ac5.2 billion in funding from EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) revenues, allocated through the Innovation Fund, to support clean tech innovation, with a significant focus on hydrogen and industrial decarbonization. This initiative, covered by 7 articles from 7 sources with overwhelmingly positive sentiment (average score 0.69), represents a substantial investment in achieving the EU\u2019s climate objectives and bolstering its industrial competitiveness. The funding is structured through a \u20ac2.9 billion call for 2025 Net-Zero Technologies and auctions for hydrogen production. \n\nStakeholders largely support the initiative, with Teresa Ribera of the European Commission highlighting its role in technological leadership and decarbonization, and Hydrogen Europe acknowledging it as positive for market growth. However, Hydrogen Europe also expresses concerns regarding potential loopholes in resilience criteria. The total funding package is part of a larger commitment of up to \u20ac100 billion for industry decarbonization and builds on an existing \u20ac40 billion Innovation Fund budget, with \u20ac15.8 billion already awarded. The initiative aims to unlock both public and private investment in the sector.",
