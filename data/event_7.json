      "body": "Cheap steel imports from Asia are putting pressure on Europe, prompting Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe to decide to close its critical facilities in Germany and France. As 1,200 jobs are at risk, the company is preparing to lay off 11,000 people by 2030 and significantly reduce its production capacity.\n\nThyssenkrupp Steel Europe announced that the facility in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and the Isbergues facility in France will be completely closed until the end of the year starting from mid-December. In a statement from the company, it was noted that the Isbergues facility will operate at only 50% capacity for at least four months starting in January.\n\nThis decision was emphasized as a measure against the significant increase in low-priced steel imports from Asia. The statement indicated that approximately 1200 employees' jobs at the Gelsenkirchen and French subsidiaries are at risk due to the pressure from these imports.\n\nIt was stated that electrical steel, widely preferred in the energy sector, transformers used in substations, and wind turbines, was produced at Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe's Gelsenkirchen and Isbergues facilities. It was pointed out that the company is among the last manufacturers in Europe producing this material, along with Polish Stalprodukt SA.\n\nWhile it was noted that a significant portion of steel imports in the European market is supplied by companies such as China's Baowu, South Korea's POSCO, and Japan's Nippon Steel, it was reported that European manufacturers are under serious pressure due to increasing competition with Asia, rising energy costs following the Russia-Ukraine war, and the slowdown in the global economy.\n\nIt was expressed that the uncontrolled increase in imports occurring at prices significantly below production costs across the European Union is putting pressure on the sector. It was mentioned that steel imports to the EU have tripled since 2022 and are expected to increase by another 50% by 2025, leading to European manufacturers operating at low capacity.\n\nIt was noted that Thyssenkrupp's steel division, which has been under financial pressure for years, plans to lay off approximately 11,000 people by 2030. As part of the restructuring process, the company aims to reduce its production capacity from 11.5 million tons to a range of 8.7 to 9 million tons, while it was stated that Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe currently employs around 27,000 people.",

Consequently, immediate measures to ensure the economic stabilization of operations are essential.\"\n\nAccording to Thyssenkrupp, some 1,200 jobs in Germany and France may be at risk.\n\n\"Grain-oriented electrical steel is an indispensable element for Europe's energy infrastructure and the energy transition,\" said chief executive Marie Jaroni.\n\n\"We are firmly committed to maintaining production in Europe, and are currently working to ensure effective market protections.\"",

      "title": "German industrial giant expects huge loss",
      "body": "The German industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp is going through one of the most difficult phases in its history. The company from Essen predicts a net loss of between 400 and 800 million euros in the current financial year. This is a direct consequence of extensive restructuring, especially in their steel division, which was one of the pillars of the business for decades.\n\nThe restructuring plan also includes costs of around 350 million euros, which are mainly related to the steel and automotive sectors. An additional cash outflow of between 300 and 600 million euros is expected. The company's shares reacted immediately; a 13 percent drop was recorded on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe plan envisages a reduction in the number of employees in steel plants by about 40 percent, which means approximately 11,000 fewer workers. Steel production will decrease from 11.5 to around nine million tons. The company plans to invest in low-carbon technologies in order to adapt to modern standards and sustainability. \"This deal lays the groundwork for the sale of the steel division,\" said Thyssenkrupp, which is currently negotiating with India's Jindal Steel.\n\nThe sale of the shipbuilding division earlier this year was a significant step forward, but the fate of the steel business remains uncertain. \"The concern is going through a multi-year restructuring with the aim of separating five main business units and transforming into a holding company,\" they added in the statement.\n\nFor now, expert analysts monitor market trends and emphasize that investments in modernization and sustainability are key to the company's future. Investors are cautious, and the situation in the steel sector in Europe further complicates the outlook.\n\nThus, Thyssenkrupp is at a crossroads - while on the one hand it plans innovation and cost reduction, on the other hand it must balance between job preservation and profitability. This year shows how difficult it is to maintain the position of an industrial giant in a modern, global economic environment.\n\nmany companies had similar problems and challenges they had to face. We will see how they can handle this in the future.",

      "title": "Shares in Germany's Thyssenkrupp slide as it forecasts heavy losses",
      "body": "Thyssenkrupp is entangled in a restructuring process as it seeks to shore up its finances, hit by high energy costs and cheap competition.\n\nGerman manufacturer Thyssenkrupp saw its share price slide on Tuesday as it predicted a heavy loss for the current financial year.\n\nAs of around 1.30pm Frankfurt, shares had dropped 8.85%, paring more dramatic losses seen earlier in the day.\n\nThe steelmaker and engineering firm said it expects negative free cash flow between \u20ac300mn and \u20ac600mn in its fiscal year that ends on 30 September 2026. That's before mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThyssenkrupp also said it expects to make a loss of between \u20ac400mn and \u20ac800mn in the current fiscal year.\n\n\"Our forecast takes account of the persistently challenging market conditions and of the efficiency and restructuring measures in our segments,\" said Dr. Axel Hamann, chief financial officer of Thyssenkrupp.\n\n\"The determined implementation of our efficiency and cost-cutting programs in all segments is crucial for our earnings development.\"\n\nHamann added that the company had met its financial targets for the year just ended, despite challenging market conditions.\n\nThyssenkrupp generated positive free cash flow of \u20ac363mn during this period, significantly above the prior year's loss of \u20ac110mn. Sales came to \u20ac32.8bn, in line with expectations but marking a 6% year-on-year drop.\n\nIn the year ahead, Thyssenkrupp predicts restructuring costs at \u20ac350mn as it seeks to boost its long-term profitability.\n\nLast week, Thyssenkrupp's steel unit said it would start implementing job cuts after agreeing a long-awaited deal with unions. Under the terms of the agreement, the firm will eliminate 11,000 posts at its steel plants, amounting to 40% of the workforce there. Steel production will be cut by as much as 2.8 mn tonnes, a roughly 25% drop.\n\nThyssenkrupp has become a symbol of Germany's ailing manufacturing industry, hit by Europe's energy price spike and competition from cheaper Asian competitors. Lacklustre market demand, linked to weak post-pandemic growth in Europe, has also shrunk margins -- with carmakers notably reducing their purchases of steel and automotive parts.\n\nOnce a powerhouse with divisions spanning from engineering to elevators and defence, Thyssenkrupp is now looking to spin off its flailing arms into separate businesses.\n\nIndian group Jindal Steel is currently mulling a takeover of Thyssenkrupp's steel unit, replacing contender Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd -- a Czech billionaire who stepped back from a potential deal earlier this year. K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd returned the 20% stake in the steel unit he had already bought and abandoned plans to raise the holding to 50%. One key priority for the steel unit is decarbonisation, with Thyssenkrupp already investing in low-carbon manufacturing methods.\n\nThyssenkrupp also managed to offload its marine division TKMS earlier this year, listing it on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.",

  "executive_brief": "Thyssenkrupp has paused steel production at two sites due to competitive pressure from cheaper Asian steel imports, as reported in 8 articles from 8 sources between December 9th and 12th, 2025. The overwhelmingly negative sentiment (-0.71) surrounding this event indicates significant concern about the future of European steel production and Thyssenkrupp\u2019s financial stability. This situation highlights broader trade tensions and the challenges faced by European manufacturers in competing with lower-cost producers in Asia. \n\nThe European Union and Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe are advocating for trade protection measures, citing the need to shield the industry from \u201ccheap Chinese imports\u201d and restore capacity utilization. Asian steel companies like Baowu, POSCO, and Nippon Steel benefit from the current market dynamics. Thyssenkrupp faces substantial financial headwinds, with expected losses of up to EUR 800,000,000 next year, largely attributed to restructuring costs within its steel division, despite a recent EUR 532,000,000 profit. Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd abandoned a potential takeover, signaling investor caution.",
