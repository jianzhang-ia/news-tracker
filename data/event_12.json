      "title": "Electric vehicles outperform hybrids on efficiency and cost, new analysis shows - Green Building Africa",
      "body": "Battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) deliver the strongest benefits to motorists and the environment across the spectrum of new-energy vehicles, according to a new analysis from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).\n\n\"South Africa has recently seen rising interest in plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), yet these vehicles combine the worst of both worlds,\" says Hiten Parmar, Executive Director of The Electric Mission. \"While they may appear to address range-anxiety concerns, they fall short of the benefits claimed by many manufacturers.\"\n\nReal-world data shows that PHEVs consume more energy in electric mode than comparable BEVs. When driven using their combustion engines, their fuel consumption and CO\u2082 emissions exceed those of traditional petrol or diesel vehicles -- in some cases by up to five times more than advertised. ICCT's findings also suggest this performance gap is widening, ultimately leaving consumers to bear the cost of inefficiency.\n\n\"The hybrid design comes with significant compromises,\" Parmar says. \"Their extra weight reduces efficiency, and running costs are higher than those of BEVs because hybrids must follow standard internal-combustion maintenance schedules while carrying both a battery and a fuel tank. Zero-emission vehicles are designed to curb local air pollution, especially in cities, and hybrids are far less effective at delivering these improvements. Battery-electric and fuel-cell electric vehicles are simply better equipped to enhance urban air quality.\"\n\nDespite lingering misconceptions about range, Parmar adds that even South Africa's most affordable BEV models can comfortably meet typical daily-driving needs. Home charging, he notes, remains the most economical and convenient way to power an electric vehicle.",

      "title": "The Truth About PHEV Batteries: Which Automakers Age Gracefully... And Which Don't",
      "body": "Despite the ever-increasing prices of new vehicles, we can at least say that advancements in efficiency technology have also had a rapid pace in recent years. Electrification is at the forefront of automotive tech, and one of the segments with the most development is plug-in hybrid systems.\n\nJust recently, the ADAC (the German equivalent of AAA in the U.S.) did a study where they measured the durability of plug-in hybrid vehicles over time. Although these results aren't the end-all be-all, they do give us a good idea of what factors are at play and which brands are finding success. Curious to know the results? Let's break it down.\n\nGerman Luxury Giants Lead The Way\n\nMost of us know that all batteries, whether they are in your smartphone or car, lose their charge over time. The batteries found in PHEVs (plug-in hybrid vehicles) are no different, but the real question is how much juice you are losing, and how fast you are losing it. The ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club) teamed up with the global leader in independent battery testing, AVILOO, to devise a study that evaluated 28,500 PHEVs across six different automakers in order to find out.\n\nMercedes-Benz Takes The Top Spot\n\nOf the six brands tested in this study, Mercedes came out as the top performer among the bunch. The data showed that Mercedes PHEVs observed the least amount of degradation of battery health, and these vehicles retained about 90-percent of their original capacity after 124,000 miles. The data also showed that regardless of the primary use of gas or EV modes, battery degradation was about equal across Mercedes models.\n\nBMW Was A Close Second\n\nBMW was right behind their perennial rivals, Mercedes, taking the second-place spot in this study. The data displayed that BMW PHEV models that utilized primarily gasoline modes also managed to retain about 90 percent of battery health after 124,000 miles. However, when the vehicle was utilized primarily in EV mode, the State of Health (SoH) value dropped to 77 percent. There were also more poor-performing outliers among BMW PHEVs when compared to Mercedes PHEVs.\n\nThis 4-Year-Old Luxury BMW Plug-in Hybrid SUV Now Costs Less Than A New Corolla\n\nIf you prioritize luxury, this used German PHEV SUV should be on your shopping list.\n\nPosts\n\nBy Nikesh Kooverjee\n\nAug 10, 2025\n\nThe Best Of The Rest: Volkswagen And More\n\nConsidering this is a German study, they made sure to touch all corners of their domestic market, including Volkswagen. Overall, Volkswagen PHEVs did perform well, managing about 85 percent battery health after 124,000 miles. The study detailed that there were more poor-performing outliers compared to BMW or Mercedes, but they were not the worst of the group. It is important to note that we currently do not have a single Volkswagen PHEV for sale in the U.S., and as of now, the automaker isn't planning on changing their stance in that regard.\n\nFord Still A Work In Progress\n\nOf the Ford vehicles tested in this study, most displayed a significant drop-off in battery health, down to about 90 percent early on in their lifespans (15,000 miles). They further detail that this trend flattens out as mileage increases. However, the data is less solid for Ford than other brands in the study because there was a smaller sample size available of high-mileage Ford PHEVs.\n\nMitsubishi Still Figuring It Out\n\nThe lowest-performing brand in this study was Mitsubishi, whose models showed the worst degradation and the greatest inconsistency. When utilized primarily in EV modes, SoH figures for Mitsubishi PHEVs dropped under 70 percent after 124,000 miles. Even Mitsubishi PHEVs with light EV usage still dropped under 80 percent battery health by 62,000 miles, a significant reduction compared to other rival brands.\n\nIt Looks Bad On Impact, But This Midsize SUV Might Save Your Life\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander earns some impressive safety scores from the IIHS.\n\nPosts 1\n\nBy Nikesh Kooverjee\n\nNov 1, 2025\n\nKey Findings Related to PHEV Batteries\n\nThough it may be obvious, greater usage of EV modes in PHEVs means more charging cycles, which leads to greater battery degradation on average. However, replacing the battery unit in your PHEV down the line should not be a significant concern or a fear factor for any prospective PHEV owners. This was once a major worry with early PHEVs, but the data debunks the myth. Research has shown that modern PHEV platforms are incredibly consistent and reliable, with only 1.5 percent of PHEVS from 2011 to 2023 requiring a battery replacement.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2023, that figure dropped even lower to one percent. New PHEVs have never been more solid, as battery packs on PHEV vehicles after the 2015 model year are more than likely to survive past the average lifespan of the vehicle. Thus, even if a PHEV's battery health decreases over time, its functional capacity will never diminish entirely given the lifespan of the vehicle.\n\nThe Expected Standard Of A Used PHEV Battery\n\nJust like when buying any used car, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is a smart way to protect your investment. Yet, with PHEVs, the process is just a little bit more complicated as you will also want to ensure the SoH of the batteries before pulling the plug. However, nowadays, you yourself can check SoH along with many other details about the battery's condition with an OBII Bluetooth dongle and an app, such as EVScanner.\n\nAccording to the ADAC data, the following SoH values should be achieved:\n\n* At least 92 percent at 31,000 miles\n\n* At least 88 percent at 62,000 miles\n\n* At least 84 percent at 93,000 miles\n\n* At least 80 percent at 124,000 miles\n\nAvoid PHEVs That Don't Meet The Standard\n\nIf you find and test a used PHEV that is under the set values we just outlined, that should be an immediate red flag. While lower than standard values aren't a guarantee of an issue, abnormal SoH figures could point to failing or excessively aged battery cells. As we mentioned, replacement of PHEV battery systems is incredibly rare, but the last thing you want to do is take chances in this situation. Because the fact does remain that if the battery of a PHEV does need to be replaced, the vehicle may be determined as a total loss due to the cost of the repair (if no longer under warranty). If you want your PHEV battery to last as long as possible, ADAC recommends avoiding charging up to 100 percent capacity. Instead, loads between 20 and 80 percent are considered the optimal range to ensure the longevity of the battery system.\n\nI Really Didn't Expect This Plug-In Hybrid To Be This Good\n\nThe auto industry has released a slew of competitive plug-in hybrids in recent years. But I did not expect this one to be this good.\n\nPosts 1\n\nBy William Clavey\n\nSep 9, 2025\n\nWarranties, Regulations, And Other Considerations\n\nWhile warranties concerning PHEVs are mostly the same as their gas-powered counterparts, there are some slight differences between the two. First, battery degradation is inevitable, so warranties typically cover a minimum expected capacity standard, not a guarantee of 100 percent efficiency throughout the lifespan of the vehicle. Most hybrid vehicles' warranties also cover all hybrid-related components, such as the battery, the battery control module, and the inverter with converter.\n\nStandard hybrid-related coverage across most automakers is for eight years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first. However, for example, Toyota, as of the 2020 model year, increased its coverage to ten years from the date of first use or 150,000 miles, whichever comes first. As you can see, confidence in the reliability of hybrid platforms has only increased over time, with battery-related failures being extremely rare occurrences as opposed to being a common expectation.\n\nAs we detailed, a PHEV battery is not considered outside its expected range as long as it retains 80 percent or more of its SoH at 124,000 miles. Yet, if that figure drops below 75 percent while the vehicle is still under warranty, the battery system may be subject to replacement. California has set a recent regulatory standard in this regard, beginning with the 2026 model year, requiring that all BEV batteries retain at least 70 percent of their range for ten years or 150,000 miles. Furthermore, 2030 models and beyond must retain 80 percent for the same period. As you can see, the California standard is more or less in line with the SoH data validated by the ADAC study. Yet, as we know, PHEV platforms have never been stronger than now, and they will only be even better in the near future as electrification takes more and more of the forefront in the automotive industry.\n\nSources: ADAC, Energy.gov, Kelley Blue Book.",

      "body": "A plug-in hybrid can go far on electric power and use minimal fuel, but studies have shown that this is not happening in many more developed countries.\n\nSouth African households that cannot charge a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle at home should not consider such a vehicle, as it will offer no fuel efficiency or cost benefit over a regular petrol model.\n\nSales of PHEVs have surged in South Africa over the past year, driven by the increasing availability of sub-R1 million models from Chinese brands, including Chery, Haval, Jaecoo, and Omoda. According to data collected by the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa, PHEV sales reached 2,135 units in the first 10 months of 2025, up 29% from the same period last year. Actual sales might be much higher, as the figure excludes sales from another major PHEV manufacturer, BYD. PHEVs are positioned as a best-of-both-worlds option, combining electric efficiency over short ranges with the long-distance convenience of a conventional petrol or diesel-powered car. The biggest benefit of PHEVs is that they have a large battery that enables them to run entirely on electric power for in-city driving, providing a smoother and more responsive driving experience. The battery can also significantly reduce fuel use, and by implication, running costs. However, achieving these benefits requires charging up the battery from an external power source at the best possible price. Although PHEVs can also charge their batteries using the engine and regenerative braking -- similar to closed-loop hybrids -- not plugging them in regularly will substantially increase reliance on fuel. Transport & Environment recently conducted a study of 127,000 PHEVs and found they consumed just 19% less petrol than non-hybrid models, while their stated consumption values claimed 75% improvements. The main reason for this was that the official values assumed a much higher proportion of electric-only driving than what was achieved. \"The gap is mostly caused by flawed assumptions on the share of electric driving mode which leads to a drastic underestimate of official PHEV emissions,\" the report found. \"The UF overestimated the electric driving share, assuming 84% over 2021-2023, whereas real-world data shows this to be just 27%.\"Haval H6 GT PHEV, one of the new models launched this year. In addition to people plugging in less than expected, many of the PHEVs had electric motors too weak to support all the driving, even when the battery was at a sufficient level of charge. The research found that PHEV drivers had to pay over \u20ac500 more per year than the official values implied, due to higher fuel consumption than advertised. PHEVs could arguably be better suited for South Africa than many developed countries with highly urbanised populations. South Africa's residential market has a much larger proportion of free-standing homes than Europe or the United Kingdom, and the average property is more likely to have its own parking. In the United Kingdom, the average residential property is about 828 square feet, converting to 77 square metres. In addition, many homes are part of multi-floor apartments that don't have dedicated parking for residents where they can charge their cars. In South Africa, the average square metres of free-standing houses ranges between 106 and 233 square metres in the eight most urbanised metros. For townhouses, the range dropped to between 98 and 175 square metres, still substantially larger than in the UK. More people in South Africa also rely on their own personal vehicle to get around than in the UK or Europe, which has substantially better public transport. That means local residential developers must offer large parking spaces with at least one or two dedicated parking bays per unit.The cost of plugging a PHEV like the BYD Shark in at a public charger will likely work out more per kilometre than simply using petrol. Photographer: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock.com In countries where parking space is limited, having numerous public chargers with competitive rates is essential. However, in South Africa, most public EV chargers are significantly more expensive to use than when charging at home. At the typical public AC charger in South Africa, motorists can expect to fork out R5.88 per kWh, compared to roughly R4 per kWh on Eskom's most common residential tariff plan. At faster DC chargers, the price goes up to R7.00 or R7.35 per kWh, depending on the provider. The effective per-km cost of energy at these chargers is about on par with petrol for equivalent models. However, the initial upfront cost of an EV or PHEV is substantially higher than that of a similar petrol or diesel model. If you will rely on public charging to top up your car's battery, you will only pay more for the car in the long run, in addition to waiting longer for a full charge than simply refuelling the tank.This might be the smartest new-car buy in South Africa: Why the Mahindra XUV 3XO makes everything else look expensive\n\nSimilar News:You can also read news stories similar to this one that we have collected from other news sources.\n\nCriminal Case Filed Against Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla Over Recruitment of South Africans for Russia-Ukraine WarNkosazana Bonganini Zuma-Mncube has filed a criminal case against her sister, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, alleging the recruitment of 17 South African men who are now trapped in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Rare cases of sponsored projects are clearly indicated.\n\n* Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to gain market share worldwide, despite policy reversals in the US.\n\n* Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) account for most EV sales globally. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have seen significant increases recently, especially in China, shifting from a defensive tool for legacy automakers to a technology that can strengthen China's global influence.\n\n* While long-range PHEVs and extended-range EVs can play a transitional role in US automaking, securing resilient industrial leadership will ultimately depend on advancing BEVs and reducing risks of overdependence in battery value chains.\n\nThe global automotive industry is undergoing a historic transformation. Electric vehicles (EVs) -- including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) -- are rapidly gaining market share worldwide. China has experienced the deepest transformation, followed by Europe -- despite considerable heterogeneity within it -- and by the US.\n\nBEVs account for most EV sales globally, but PHEVs have experienced particularly dynamic growth in recent years.[i] Once viewed as a transitional technology favored by legacy automakers, PHEVs have now become central to China's domestic EV market growth and to its industrial strategy. Chinese automakers embraced PHEVs and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) as a way to complement BEVs to expand their global reach, effectively leveraging the advantages offered by a deeply rooted and competitive battery supply chain.\n\nThe overall global shift to EVs raises a critical question for US automakers and policymakers: Should EVs be defended, ignored, or strategically supported, and if so, which ones?\n\nBecause of the scale and pervasiveness of this technological transition, accelerating the shift to EVs would strengthen the resilience of the US auto sector. Instead of policies that focus solely on incremental improvements to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), those that support PHEVs, which retain an internal combustion engine, can play a transitional role to fully battery-powered cars. However, securing resilient industrial leadership will ultimately depend on advancing BEVs and reducing the risks of overdependence on concentrated battery value chains.\n\nBEVs, PHEVs, and Diverging Global Paths\n\nIn many regions of the world, the car market has developed in markedly new directions in recent years (see Figure 1). In 2024 plug-in vehicles -- both BEVs and PHEVs -- accounted for roughly one in five new cars sold worldwide.[ii] Estimates for 2025 point toward increasing market share and a total of roughly 20 million electric cars sold.[iii] Yet beneath this aggregate figure lies striking regional differences in both technology choice and adoption speed.\n\nNote: \"e\" indicates that the value is an estimate based on partial-year data and is therefore forward-looking.\n\nSource: Estimate based on International Energy Agency, EV Volumes, BloombergNEF, Global Fuel Economy Initiative, European Environment Agency, European Automobile Manufacturers Association, European Alternative Fuels Observatory, Allianz, New AutoMotive, S&P Global, ING, PwC and Strategy&, JATO Dynamics and Japanese Automotive Manufacturers Association.[iv]\n\nChina\n\nChina has experienced the deepest transformation. In 2024 it represented about 60 percent of global EV sales, with BEVs making up the bulk of EV deliveries but PHEVs growing rapidly (see Figure 1). BYD, an automobile manufacturing company headquartered in China, led in total EV sales globally and outsold Tesla on BEVs alone in late 2024.[v] China's grip on battery manufacturing -- from raw material processing to cell production[vi] -- enables low costs and high volumes across both BEVs and PHEVs.\n\nEurope\n\nEurope is the second key pole of electrification globally in terms of sales and domestic manufacturing, though with marked heterogeneity among countries and with remaining reliance on China in its battery value chain.[vii] Nordic countries such as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are at the forefront of the electrification of the car fleet in the EU, with EVs, and in particular BEVs, already having high market shares.[viii] In contrast, several countries in southern and eastern Europe -- including Cyprus, Greece, Italy, and much of central and eastern Europe -- lag behind, constrained by lower incomes, higher sensitivity to vehicle purchase prices, and, in the case of Italy, high electricity prices.[ix] Within the EU's regulatory framework, PHEVs have played a transitional role between ICEVs and BEVs. However, as regulatory signals and tax incentives evolve and charging expands, consumer demand is favoring BEVs.\n\nUS\n\nThe United States presents a different picture. EVs accounted for 10 percent of its car sales in 2024. BEVs are clearly ahead of PHEVs in terms of new car registrations, representing about 80 percent of total electric car sales that year.[x] This aligns with the outsize role of Tesla in shaping consumer preferences, brand perception, and charging infrastructure.[xi]\n\nWhile some legacy automakers continue to offer PHEVs, US demand for PHEVs versus ICEVs is structurally constrained by relatively low gasoline prices, resulting in limited space for cost savings from PHEVs. The US capital market also tends to place a significantly higher premium (in terms of market capitalization per unit of vehicle sold) on companies that focus on BEVs rather than PHEVs (and other combustion-based technologies).\n\nOther Markets\n\nThe Korean car market has seen EVs rise to nearly 15 percent in 2024 and 2025, with 2025 developments pointing toward an increased focus on BEVs and a stagnation of PHEV sales.[xii] Japan has a technology mix in its domestic market that remained strongly centered on ICEVs and hybrids,[xiii] in line with the focus of its main automakers and concerns about limitations in access to battery material supplies. It recorded limited EV market demand compared with other major developed economies.\n\nFrom Southeast Asia to parts of Latin America and Africa, there has been a rapid acceleration in EV adoption.[xiv] Much of this expansion is directly or indirectly linked to Chinese investment, both in vehicles (via exports or local assembly) and infrastructure (including charging and battery plants). In markets such as Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, and parts of Africa, Chinese EVs are gaining market share, while Western automakers are subject to a competitive disadvantage because they focus more on premium segments (which are less affordable) and have lower EV sales volumes overall compared with Chinese competitors.[xv] In other cases, such as Vietnam, the growth in EV market shares was paired with the rise of domestic EV manufacturers. However, they still rely, at least in part, on Chinese battery suppliers.[xvi]\n\nIn short, while EV sales are increasing globally, the global EV map remains uneven. China is leading in sales of both BEVs and PHEVs, whereas Europe has a high share of BEV purchases within its electric car market, especially in the North, with a patchier picture elsewhere. The US is BEV-heavy but has a relatively narrow overall EV share. Korea tracks EU developments, with some lag, while Japan maintains a focus on hybrids. Emerging markets are entering the race largely on the back of Chinese industrial and financial support.\n\nThree Drivers of the Transition\n\nThe EV transition is not only about technology but also about economics, geopolitics, and climate commitments.\n\nIndustrial and Economic Competitiveness\n\nFor China, EVs are part of a broader attempt to dominate a future-defining industry.[xvii] For Europe, they are a necessity to preserve automotive leadership while meeting climate obligations.[xviii] For the US, they represent a challenge to the legacy automotive manufacturing and oil sectors -- long central to its industrial base -- while at the same time offering a pathway to offset risks of net industrial capacity losses, which becomes essential if the US market also shifts toward electrification. Investments in batteries and related supply chains are not just about cars; they are also about commanding value-added industries of the future and industrial production that matters for national security and defense.\n\nEnergy and Resource Security\n\nFor net oil importers, EVs are a strategic hedge against oil dependence. China, the EU, India, and many African, Latin American, and Southeast Asian countries rely heavily on imported crude and refined products. Reducing oil dependence through electrification -- as well as the associated energy efficiency improvements of EVs, which consume about one quarter of the final energy needed by a comparable combustion car[xix] -- is therefore an economic and security imperative for countries in these circumstances.\n\nBuilding a competitive battery value chain also offers resource security if it can leverage -- as in the case of oil supplies -- a reliable network of global partners. And contrary to oil, battery materials will become increasingly available in economies using BEVs once the vehicles reach the end of their useful life through recycling.\n\nClimate Policies\n\nEV adoption is also propelled by emissions regulations, climate targets, and clean air priorities -- such as China's \"new energy vehicle\" mandates and the EU's CO\u2082 emission standards -- as EVs have lower life-cycle emissions than alternative technologies.[xx] The US corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard, state-level \"zero emission vehicle\" (ZEV) standards developed in California and other states, and other instruments supporting EV demand and infrastructure development were also driven by climate policy goals, though these are now the object of major revisions by the Trump administration.\n\nImportantly, the strength of these three drivers varies: Concerns about energy security and industrial goals tend to reinforce each other in China and the EU, resulting in policies that have supported the EV transition. In the EU, additional synergies came from a strong determination to act on climate. In the US, abundant domestic oil has blunted the energy security case, and while climate was a clear driver of prior policy action on EVs, the current administration does not support policies addressing climate change.[xxi] Despite such headwinds, industrial competitiveness and the promotion of innovation have long been a focus of US policy, and recent trade policy decisions seem to suggest that interest remains in supporting domestically produced EVs and achieving greater diversification of battery supply chains.[xxii] However, this interest comes with a reduced pace and scale for the EV transition, and hence also with delays in emission reductions.\n\nPHEVs: From Defensive Play to China-Centered Growth\n\nThe role of PHEVs has evolved markedly over the past decade. In a first phase, they were mainly part of a defensive strategy by legacy original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) In a second phase, growing pressures from BEVs and increasing evidence about the limits of PHEVs to promote energy diversification and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions challenged the effectiveness of this initial strategy. A third, more recent phase is a Chinese offensive strategy to leverage its competitive advantage in batteries and gain global market share.\n\nInitially, PHEVs were developed largely by incumbent automakers as a hedge against BEVs. Legacy manufacturers, heavily invested in ICEV platforms, saw PHEVs as a way to meet regulatory targets without committing to the cost and risk of full battery electrification. In Europe, policy incentives also encouraged this strategy.\n\nPHEVs lost traction and policy support, however, as BEV sales grew (fueled by Tesla and Chinese pure-play EV makers) and critiques pointed to low energy diversification and climate benefits of PHEVs, which run much less than initially expected in all-electric mode. These critiques were backed by strong evidence[xxiii] and confirmed by official data collection,[xxiv] which led to policy revisions in the EU[xxv] and the US.[xxvi]\n\nSince 2022, however, PHEVs have experienced a resurgence, especially in China. Unlike the earlier defensive stance by legacy OEMs in Europe, China's recent PHEV surge reflects a more offensive strategy. With world-leading battery production, Chinese OEMs such as BYD have launched PHEVs with large batteries and long electric ranges -- including in the form of EREVs -- ensuring more frequent all-electric operation. Domestic demand soared because of total cost of ownership advantages compared with ICEV, partial eligibility for preferential licensing in Chinese cities,[xxvii] improvements in battery technologies needed in PHEVs,[xxviii] and the introduction of new models with larger batteries and fast-charging capabilities.[xxix] Lower upfront prices for PHEVs compared with BEVs in a few market segments[xxx] may also have played a role. Consumer interest in the flexibility that PHEVs offer compared with BEVs may also have supported demand growth, especially where there is limited cost-effective charging infrastructure.[xxxi] Importantly, exports of PHEVs and EREVs can also provide an avenue to bypass tariffs or countervailing duties, as those tend to focus on BEVs.\n\nBy now the fulcrum of PHEV market development has shifted decisively to China. What was once a transitional technology favored by legacy Western OEMs is now being redefined by Chinese firms as a competitive instrument, integrated with global trade strategy and industrial policy.\n\nThe Outlook for Electric Vehicles: The US and Beyond\n\nIn the US, the structural outlook for PHEVs is limited, while the outlook for BEVs is also weaker than it was before recent policy reversals. Factors that influence market developments include the following:\n\n* Reduced compliance value. Policy frameworks (e.g., CAFE standards, ZEV programs) still allow BEVs, EREVs, and PHEVs to generate compliance value, but recent policy reversals are weakening this effect.\n\n* Low gasoline prices. By global standards, US fuel prices are low. This reduces the operating-cost savings of driving on electricity, weakening the economic rationale for EVs. However, heterogeneity in fuel prices, state-level regulations, and fiscal incentives can still sustain demand for BEVs and PHEVs in sizable portions of the US. They could also sustain demand for EREVs, but model availability is still limited.\n\n* Weak domestic battery base. Compared with China, US battery manufacturing lags in scale and cost competitiveness, limiting the ability of US OEMs to offer low-cost, long-range EVs. Tariffs applicable to long-standing US trade partners exacerbate these challenges.\n\n* Battery supply chain challenges. Limited access to battery materials and cells and slower scale-up of domestic battery manufacturing capacity -- due to a contraction of the BEV market versus expectations and the negative impacts of tariffs following the recent policy shifts -- may delay cost reductions and lower the volumes of domestically manufactured EV batteries. Such a development could result in an increased value proposition for PHEVs and EREVs compared with BEVs, reversing the historically limited demand for PHEVs in the US electric car market.\n\n* Battery cost declines. Continued reductions in EV battery costs in other markets may still help tilt the market toward BEVs rather than PHEVs or EREVs. Once purchase prices converge, BEVs' lower operating costs and better performance make them the predominant choice. The PHEV value proposition -- cheaper up front if more expensive over time -- erodes in these conditions, especially for legacy configurations.\n\n* Charging infrastructure developments. Consumers without reliable charging infrastructure may also prefer PHEVs or EREVs, even in an environment where BEVs become more competitive pricewise.\n\nChina\n\nIn China, structural drivers behind increased electrification remain strong, despite challenges emerging from increased competition and significant overcapacity. BEVs are therefore bound to continue to account for millions of units sold, as they have in the recent past. PHEV and EREV shares may continue to expand over the next 5 to 10 years, thanks to the same drivers that favored their recent increase, both in terms of domestic demand and utility in circumventing trade barriers when supply is geared toward exports (if the focus of trade barriers on BEVs does not change). The new generation of Chinese PHEVs -- including EREVs equipped with larger batteries -- is also particularly well suited to meeting requirements regarding all-electric driving shares, which are now also being tightened domestically.[xxxii]\n\nEurope\n\nBEVs are bound to see continued market share increases in Europe. This is driven by policy, particularly the regulation requiring zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2035. It is also driven by economics, including EV technology cost reductions, high oil import dependency, high fuel taxation, the introduction of carbon pricing, and the use of differentiated taxation based on the environmental performance of vehicles, which favors BEVs.\n\nPHEVs have faced declining incentives, especially for models with low all-electric range, because of tightened regulatory requirements.[xxxiii] They are also subject to equity-related challenges, as they have solely been deployed in premium segments, steering incentives meant to support demand creation for EVs toward wealthier people.[xxxiv]\n\nFuture policy action will remain focused on road transport electrification, as indicated by the announced proposals regarding corporate fleets,[xxxv] even if revisions to existing regulations are also being considered. Recent announcements regarding smaller, more affordable EVs will help diversify the offer of BEVs and are not likely to favor PHEVs, given their focus on larger and heavier cars.[xxxvi] However, revising the 2035 emission reduction requirements toward greater technological neutrality[xxxvii] could offer opportunities for a greater share of PHEVs in the European EV market than in the current policy framework.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn emerging markets, Chinese EVs are likely going to continue to be cheaper than those from other suppliers, especially for BEVs.[xxxviii] PHEVs may see growing demand where charging infrastructure is limited and where policy requirements for larger battery capacities and higher all-electric driving shares are not yet adopted (while Chinese EREVs can gain interest in cases where this tightening is already in place).\n\nThe outlook for Korea points toward an overall EV market share increase that remains less dynamic than in the EU, but with a strengthened focus on BEVs.[xxxix] Japan is expected to continue facing challenges in stimulating domestic EV demand.[xl] However, the export-oriented nature of Korean and Japanese automotive industries and the risks of market share losses in Asia are likely to strengthen the case for greater diversification of their power train offerings toward EVs.\n\nOverall, and especially as batteries get cheaper and charging more widespread, BEVs are more likely to capture the bulk of the EV market growth. However, PHEVs can gain relevance as a strategy for navigating trade-related barriers and in markets that still have limited charging infrastructure. Versions with larger battery capacities are likely to gain more ground as batteries keep improving, costs decline, and policies require growing all-electric ranges.\n\nPolicy Recommendations for the US\n\nThe current US administration rolled back or paused major federal targets, programs, incentives, and infrastructure deployment investments aimed at accelerating EV adoption.[xli] It rescinded the waiver that allowed California and other states to set EV-related requirements[xlii] and proposed to remove the foundation of what allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate GHG emission standards for vehicles.[xliii] This pullback places a greater focus on protecting traditional internal combustion manufacturing than on leading new technology developments, even as interest remains for diversifying EV battery supply chains. These policy decisions are exacerbated by tariffs applied to US allies, making the competitive challenge from China and other global automakers that are not subject to the same policy reversal (despite the risk of some degree of rollback induced by US policy shifts, especially in Europe) more acute for the US.\n\nRecognizing the scale of the global transformation that is profoundly reshaping the automotive industry -- driven by economics and energy/resource security in addition to environmental considerations -- is a key prerequisite to improve the competitiveness of US OEMs in this shifting landscape. Doing so is crucial to leverage existing capacity in the automotive sector and support investments in new industrial assets. To do so, US policymakers could enact policies that accomplish the following:\n\n* Preserve and strengthen regulatory requirements on EVs, including the EPA's ability to regulate GHG emission standards for vehicles, maintain CAFE standards, and allow California and other states to set EV-related requirements. These policies drive investment and innovation that are critical in this phase of global competition for the creation of new industrial capacity.\n\n* Reinstate EV purchase incentives while also integrating equity-related considerations, such as focusing the incentives toward low-income households and businesses and using vehicle price caps for the applicability of the incentives. If budgetary implications are a concern, incentives could integrate provisions that enable them to be budget neutral, evolving from the exclusive use of credits toward a combination of incentives for EVs and fees for ICEVs. Specific conditions for the applicability of incentives can also support the diversification of EV battery supply chains; for example, they could use emission intensity thresholds for the manufacturing of batteries equipping EVs.\n\n* Use public procurement toward EVs when beneficial to the government and industry. Instruct federal institutions -- including the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the General Services Administration, and any other relevant federal departments and agencies -- to support an anticipated industry shift toward EVs. Public procurement mechanisms can also integrate the use of specific conditions regarding the attributes of batteries equipping EVs, setting minimum thresholds to support the diversification of EV battery supply chains. They can also coordinate with policies of the DOE's Office of Energy Dominance Financing (formerly the Loan Programs Office) to include specific provisions supporting innovation on mineral extraction and processing technologies (such as direct lithium extraction) to support the diversification of battery supply chains).[xliv]\n\n* Support the deployment of EV charging infrastructure, stimulating private investments. Re-staff and revitalize the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation (JOET). Focus its public spending on cases that are economically more challenging but strategically relevant to secure affordable access to EV chargers across the US to make the EV transition coherent and not just inevitable. Leverage public service contracts tied to affordability conditions regarding charging prices. Allocate specific support to the installation and maintenance of EV chargers in underserved communities. If budgetary implications are a concern, leverage a moderate carbon price on emission-intensive fuels used in road transport to address it.\n\n* Stimulate investments in cell manufacturing, recycling, and critical minerals processing in the US and in friendly or allied nations. This is crucial not only for cost parity but also for energy security and industrial resilience. Long-term, predictable regulations need to enable more clarity for demand prospects. Other instruments that can support domestic production include financing structures that reduce investment risks; targeted government interventions such as direct subsidies, grants, or tax credits; and friendshoring.[xlv] China's EV offensive is possible because of its strength across the battery supply chain; further US delays in domestic production will be detrimental to the US and its allies. If the cost of policies aimed to support investments in new industrial capacity concerns is seen as a key challenge, carbon pricing can help raise revenues to mitigate their impacts.\n\n* Phase out incentives and public procurement support for PHEVs with limited all-electric range. Without clear sunset clauses, policy decisions could amplify asset-stranding risks and slow the realignment of industrial capabilities toward automotive technologies that will continue to define global competitiveness in the coming decades. Policies that continue to favor PHEVs rather than BEVs risk exacerbating the greater EV competitive disadvantage for the US automotive industry.\n\nAbou the Author\n\nPierpaolo Cazzola is a Non-Resident Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.

      "title": "Drivers aren't charging their plug-in hybrid cars, research suggests | CBC Climate Change News",
      "body": "The audio version of this article is generated by text-to-speech, a technology based on artificial intelligence.\n\nPitched as a great compromise for the environmentally conscious yet road-tripping driver, plug-in hybrids -- or PHEVs -- have a few problems.\n\nFor one, people aren't plugging them in.\n\nStudy after study show these vehicles -- which boast an electric motor for emission-free rides and a gas engine for longer range -- are actually being used more in gas mode. This means they're polluting a lot more than a customer might think.\n\nCritics argue this discrepancy lets manufacturers get an attractive fuel consumption rating based on ideal conditions that aren't being met by many drivers.\n\nAnd as Canada considers the future of its electric vehicle regulations, there are questions about how plug-ins should count.\n\nPHEVs are about one per cent to three per cent of new Canadian car registrations in the last five years. Despite being the smallest chunk of electric car sales, that still amounts to hundreds of thousands of these vehicles on Canadian roads.\n\nThe most recent criticism of PHEVs comes from an umbrella group of environmental NGOs, which used real-world fuel consumption data from hundreds of thousands of plug-in hybrids in Europe. The data is collected in the EU as part of regulation to prevent misrepresentation and fraud, taken wirelessly or during maintenance on any new cars after 2021.\n\nThe analysis found that electric mode was only used around 30 per cent of the time, despite official assumptions it would be used more than 80 per cent of the time. Carbon emissions were nearly five times higher than projected, and driver behaviour was part of the problem.\n\n\"The first generation of plug-in hybrids was not used in electric mode very much,\" said Colin McKerracher, who leads the Transport and Energy Storage Group at Bloomberg NEF.\n\nTypically, they had battery ranges of 50 to 80 kilometres and couldn't fast charge, making it inconvenient for drivers to keep them topped up. In Europe, he says, a lot of these were company cars, further disincentivizing drivers who didn't have to pay for gas anyway.\n\nFor manufacturers, the incentive to make these cars was clear, experts say. As governments pushed to decarbonize transportation, PHEVs helped meet those new standards, McKerracher says.\n\n\"A lot of the early plug-in hybrids that were on the market were really compliance cars,\" he told CBC News from Oslo. \"They were either to satisfy [environmentally stricter] California regulations or European vehicle CO2 regulations to try and allow automakers to comply with tightening targets.\"\n\nAt the same time, adding an electric motor could allow cost-savings through the same manufacturing process as non-electric models.\n\nIn Canada, PHEVs helped manufacturers meet the Trudeau government's roadmap to make all new car sales electric by 2035 -- a mandate currently paused by the Carney government.\n\nUnder that plan, both fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars count towards a manufacturer's zero-emissions fleet, while traditional hybrids would not. PHEVs could be as much as 45 per cent of a carmaker's offerings until 2026, eventually decreasing to 20 per cent after a few years.\n\nIn a statement, Environment and Climate Change Canada said the pause on the EV mandate will \"help reduce the economic pressure due to tariffs\" and that its review \"will consider the way PHEVs are treated under the regulations, among all other relevant considerations.\"\n\nDavid Adams, president and CEO of Global Automakers of Canada, a trade association, said that some flexibility is likely required when applying emissions credits to plug-in hybrids.\n\nAt the same time, he warns against treating PHEVs too equally, as automakers have invested heavily into full EV platforms.\n\n\"You don't necessarily want your commitment in that regard undermined by governments providing almost an equivalent credit for something that's not the same cost,\" Adams explained.\n\nFor consumers, PHEVs can represent a stepping stone between traditional hybrid cars and fully battery-electric vehicles, addressing both range anxiety and a scarcity of charging stations.\n\nAs McKerracher puts it, \"So that you can still go on that long road trip, but get some of the benefits of electric driving.\"\n\nThat's the reality for Marcia Scrimgeour, a retired senior living in Ottawa.\n\nScrimgeour's city driving is served well by her 2024 Kia Niro's 55 kilometre electric range, which she charges at her condo. But when she travels to a cottage in the summer, \"there's no electrical facility -- period,\" she said.\n\nCanada's electric charging infrastructure has improved over the years, but forecasts suggest a completely electric future requires hundreds of thousands more charging stations.\n\nOn a fixed income, Scrimgeour says her plug-in hybrid helps her save money and she only filled it with gas twice last winter. But Scrimgeour did confirm the other criticism of PHEVs and their greater-than-advertised fuel consumption: the sudden switchover from electric motor to engine.\n\n\"The only time it does it unexpectedly is if I accelerate unexpectedly. Like, from a stoplight, if I start up too quickly, despite the fact that I've still got lots of electrical charge available,\" Scrimgeour said, adding that it switches back after braking.\n\nScrimgeour is the ideal use-case. But unlike in Europe, there is no widely available data about charging habits of Canadian plug-in drivers. Adam Thorn, director of the transportation program at the Pembina Institute, says it represents an \"educational opportunity.\"\n\n\"To really make sure that those who purchase those vehicles are aware of that opportunity to charge the vehicles overnight, for example,\" Thorn explained, \"[and] recognize that they're really not going to get the full fuel savings if they don't do so.\"\n\nIn that recent European analysis, the authors also found the real-world consumption meant paying about $800 more than expected at the pump.\n\nThorn sees a future for PHEVs in Canada, which doesn't involve completely scrapping the mandate, as automakers have called for.\n\n\"We really do think it's a key policy to drive down emissions,\" Thorn told CBC News from Oakville, Ont. Pembina's position recommends letting PHEV models count towards 45 per cent of a manufacturer's fleet until 2030.\n\nDespite tariff uncertainty and the dismantling of EV supports in the U.S., there is still promise in this category.\n\nMcKerracher expects around eight million PHEVs to be sold globally this year, compared to 14 million battery electric cars. What's more, even with the loss of consumer rebates earlier this year, PHEV sales seem to be holding year over year, especially compared to fully electric cars, which are down by 28,000 registrations compared to the same time last year.\n\n\"Right now, the mood seems to be that these represent actually potentially a growing segment of the zero emission vehicle portfolio,\" Adams said.",
