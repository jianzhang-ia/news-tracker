      "title": "How To Secure Ukraine Without An Article 5 Guarantee - Analysis",
      "body": "As talk of security guarantees picks up, a major component of any attempt to ensure that Ukraine is secure after the fighting stops rests on strengthening its military and improving its security environment.\n\nSpecifically, the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners should work with Kyiv to design and pursue a multilayered Ukrainian security architecture that emphasizes seven principles: (1) NATO-Ukraine interoperability, (2) long-term training and sustainment, (3) industrial fusion through the Danish model, (4) innovation integration, (5) preservation of sovereign deterrence, (6) the rollback of Russian forward deployments, and (7) Ukraine's internal military modernization.\n\nTogether, these strategies can ensure a long-term balance of power wherein Ukraine can defend itself, Europe's eastern flank is stable, and any future Russian aggression would face real and guaranteed costs.\n\nUkraine is unlikely to gain Article 5-style mutual defense from NATO. But the alliance is more than the sum of its troop formations. Its core competency is its ability to combine allied militaries under a single superstructure. The alliance operates under a shared grammar of concepts of operations, command and control, intelligence, doctrine, and training -- all forged through routine joint exercises.\n\nAs a NATO partner, Ukraine should begin learning to operate within the allied warfighting structure, regardless of its Article 5 status. NATO should continue to invite Ukraine to participate in exercises whenever possible to ensure Ukraine remains aligned with NATO doctrines and concepts of operations as well as the Euro-Atlantic geopolitical axis.\n\nNSATU, a NATO command based in Germany, has become the core operational element ensuring Ukraine's national defense. Its long-term presence is vital to bolster Ukraine's future security.\n\nHundreds of NSATU personnel help tie together the entire NATO-Ukraine security ecosystem -- without making any member nation a belligerent against Russia. It serves three main functions:\n\nIn effect, NSATU all but guarantees that Ukraine will never fight alone. The program should endure beyond the war.\n\nThe Danish model is a highly innovative framework wherein Denmark works directly with Ukraine's defense industry to finance and coproduce weapons, in some cases on Danish soil. The framework expedites deliveries, reduces costs, and, in the case of Danish-based production, insulates facilities against Russian strikes. It is the first Western mechanism that treats the Ukrainian defense industry as a business partner and supplier rather than a charity case.\n\nThe program has achieved impressive results with Bohdana howitzers. And the model is disciplined: Ukraine identifies needs, and Danish experts vet potential partner firms, with all funds flowing through Copenhagen. In 2024 alone, the Danish model generated about $631 million worth of weapons for Ukraine, financed by Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and interest payments from frozen Russian assets.\n\nBy 2025, Denmark and Norway have set the aims for $183 million worth of weapons. This framework should be the template for other willing NATO allies.\n\nUkraine's drone ecosystem -- powered by the Ministry of Digital Transformation, the Ministry of Defense, and initiatives such as Brave-1 -- is among the most dynamic in the world.\n\nNATO's DIANA program, with more than 200 accelerator hubs and test sites, is the ideal platform to fuse Ukrainian innovation with NATO procurement. DIANA provides non-dilutive grants, dual-use innovation pathways, military end-user mentoring, and access to over $1 billion of venture capital through the NATO Innovation Fund.\n\nBringing Ukraine into DIANA would turbocharge Kyiv's drone and electronic warfare industries and embed Ukrainian technology into NATO's next-generation warfighting architecture. This would allow the alliance to benefit from Ukraine's comparative advantages and help Ukraine scale its impressive innovation ecosystem.\n\nA credible security guarantee requires allowing Ukraine to maintain its own deterrent tools:\n\nA future security agreement should impose two geographic conditions on Moscow:\n\nIn return, Ukraine would not host permanent Western troop bases. If Russia refuses, NATO should reserve the right to station forces in Ukraine.\n\nMaintaining this agreement will require monitoring. So Ukraine will require routine access to allied space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; airborne early warning and control; and long-endurance surveillance drones to monitor any ceasefire or peace regime.\n\nUkraine also has work to do. The Armed Forces of Ukraine should intensify de-Sovietization across doctrine, command, procurement, ranks, high command, and tables of organization and equipment. Military and political figures like General Kyrylo Budanov and First Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov represent the future: young, adaptive, tech-driven leaders who understand algorithmic warfare and modern intelligence fusion.\n\nKyiv also needs to hardwire anticorruption safeguards into defense contracting to maintain the confidence of foreign partners that fund Ukraine and share sensitive technologies. A twenty-first-century Ukrainian military cannot operate on twentieth-century Soviet frameworks.",

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned his US counterpart, George W.

It won't be new to you, and I don't expect a response; I just want to say it out loud. I'd like to emphasize accession to NATO of a country like Ukraine will create for the long-term a field of conflict for you and us, long-term confrontation,\" Putin was quoted as saying by the US National Security Council translators.\n\nWhen asked by Bush why he though so, Putin said that this would create a threat of NATO moving its military bases and various arms systems to the exact proximity to the Russian border. Apart from that, he noted that not all the Ukrainians were happy about their country's potential membership in NATO and that a third of Ukraine's population, or 17 million people, were Russians.\n\nIn an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson in February 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Washington put pressure on other NATO countries, promoting the idea of expanding the alliance to include Ukraine and Georgia. \"In 2008, at the summit in Bucharest, they declared that the doors for Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO were open,\" he noted. \"Germany, France seemed to be against it, as well as some other European countries.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that the US nuclear umbrella is an \"absolute guarantee\" for European NATO allies.\n\n\"When it comes to nuclear deterrence, the US nuclear umbrella is our absolute guarantee, and that will not change. Certainly, several European NATO allies have their own nuclear capabilities, and we engage in both direct and indirect cooperation in this regard. There's nothing more to say on this matter,\" Rutte said in an interview with the DPA news agency. He was responding to a question about whether European NATO allies need to bolster their nuclear deterrence capabilities.\n\nThe NATO chief further expressed confidence that the United States' commitment to the alliance under President Donald Trump will remain firm. \"Their national security strategy outlines that a secure Europe, a strong NATO, and close cooperation between the US and European NATO allies are American priorities,\" Rutte emphasized. At the same time, he noted that the US has its own specific interests within NATO.\n\n\"The Arctic represents a vital issue. We observe Chinese and Russian vessels active in that region. And we can only protect the Arctic together, with European and American NATO allies acting in unison,\" Rutte asserted. He added that the North Atlantic is also pivotal for US security. \"To guarantee the security of the North Atlantic, the US needs a strong European side of NATO. We're all in the same boat not just for historical reasons but for practical ones as well,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that he would initiate discussions with allies about the possibility of placing European countries under the protection of France's nuclear deterrence forces. Germany, Poland, Lithuania, and Denmark have already expressed their readiness to discuss the issue. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul previously stated that replacing the US nuclear umbrella for Europe is not feasible in the near future, though Germany is engaged in talks with France and the UK on nuclear matters.",

Depending on intelligence assessments, the security situation could otherwise become dangerous as early as 2027, he said.\n\nRutte pointed to Russia's military spending as evidence of the threat posed by Putin, saying Moscow is now devoting more than 40% of its state budget to defence.\n\nHe added that the war in Ukraine had shown Putin's willingness to accept heavy losses, citing estimates that around 1.1 million Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded.\n\nRutte remained cautious when asked whether US-led efforts to end the war might come to fruition next year.\n\n\"I don't want to make predictions,\" the NATO chief said.\n\n\"I can only say that everybody is working extremely hard, the Americans, the Europeans, and of course, Ukraine.\"\n\nHe again stressed the importance of Ukraine being given \"very strong\" security guarantees as part of any peace deal, to prevent Russia from attacking again.\n\nRutte, who has consistently credited US President Donald Trump with \"having broken the deadlock\" in the peace negotiations after taking office in January, said he was \"not worried\" at all that Washington might no longer be a reliable partner under the new administration.\n\nHe pointed to the new US National Security Strategy, which was considered by many in Europe as a clear sign of a widening rift, saying that it \"clearly states that for the US, a priority is a safe Europe [and] a strong NATO.\"\n\n\"The US has its own specific interests in NATO, which is, of course, Europe staying safe, but also the Arctic,\" Rutte said.\n\n\"A safe Arctic is crucial for the United States, and we can only defend that together, European and American NATO allies.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rutte also expressed optimism regarding NATO defence spending, after allies agreed to raise expenditure to at least 3.5% of gross domestic product at a summit in June. Under the new targets, an additional 1.5% are to be spent on defence-related projects such as infrastructure.\n\nHe singled out Germany in particular, praising Berlin for \"a very impressive way leading the pack.\"\n\nRutte noted that Germany, Europe's biggest economy, aims to raise its defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2029, ahead of the agreed deadline of 2035.\n\n\"You have to show this leadership to the rest, and you're doing it.\"",

      "title": "Trump's Original 28-Point Peace Plan is the Least Bad Option for Ukraine and for Europe as a Whole",
      "body": "US President Donald Trump has made it very clear that he is an enemy of Europe. His administration's recent National Security Strategy contained deranged and racist raving about Europe facing \"civilizational erasure\" due to immigration from the Middle East and Africa, while also calling for interference in Europe's internal affairs by propping up far-right elements in the continent. The policy document was consistent with US Vice President JD Vance's screeching about European immigration policies at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year and even prompted some mild rebukes from the usually spineless European leaders. Paradoxically, however, Trump's original 28-point peace plan represents the least bad option for Ukraine to end the almost four-year-old grueling conflict with Russia. It might also have beneficial consequences for Europe as a whole. Trump's foreign policy agenda is mostly horrendous, and his desire to pursue peace in Ukraine may be solely motivated by a vain ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, but that does not mean the merits of the peace plan should be discounted. Trump's peace plan was greeted with almost universal dismay in Europe, whose political leaders and media commentators argued it was too favorable to Russia while essentially amounting to Ukraine's capitulation. The unfortunate reality, however, is that there are two realistic alternatives for Ukraine at the present juncture; accepting a peace deal in which Kyiv has to make painful concessions, or the continuation of carnage within Ukraine. Russia is making incremental progress on the battlefield (with an obvious advantage in terms of weaponry and troop numbers), and the sanctions on Russia, while harmful for the country's economy, are unlikely to exert sufficient pressure on Moscow in the near future. Under such circumstances, it is completely unfeasible that Ukraine could achieve a military victory in the conflict.\n\nTrump's original peace plan may have been acceptable to Moscow (at least partially), but the revised plan (based on the European counter-proposal and worked out in US Ukrainian negotiations) is unlikely to be accepted by the Kremlin. The European counter proposal was portrayed in Europe as a noble effort to save Ukraine from the Big Bad Wolf in the White House, but what it actually did was to once again undermine the hopes of ending the conflict. It was widely claimed that Trump's peace plan would have amounted to Ukraine's capitulation, but under the plan, Ukraine's sovereignty would have been confirmed, a non-aggression pact would have been signed between Russia and Ukraine, and Ukraine would have been allowed to have a standing army of 600 000 troops (dwarfing the size of the UK, French and German armies). The plan also outlined\n\na reconstruction package for Ukraine and affirmed its eligibility for membership in the European Union. The plan's stipulation of Ukraine abandoning its NATO aspirations was considered unacceptable by Kiev's European allies, but this is something the Ukrainians already agreed to in the ill-fated negotiations in the spring of 2022. It's also something that common sense dictates; everybody understands that the US government would not tolerate for a second Mexico joining a Moscow-run military alliance. Furthermore, the provocative and needless expansion of NATO in the post-Cold War period is what contributed to the current turmoil in the first place. Continuing to insist on Ukraine's sacred right to join NATO is sheer madness and a severe obstacle to peace. Indeed, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently announced that Kyiv was willing to abandon its NATO ambitions in exchange for Western security guarantees. The issue of territorial concessions is the most painful aspect of the Trump peace plan, but none of its provisions amount to \"capitulation\"; on the contrary, Ukraine already ensured there would be no capitulation by thwarting Russia's early attempts to topple Kyiv and install a puppet regime in the country. A peace deal which includes painful concessions but nevertheless maintains Ukraine's sovereignty is the best realistic option on the table.\n\nIf the Ukrainians themselves want to fight to the bitter end before ceding a single square meter of their territory, that is their right. However, there is a curious feature in the contemporary European discourse on the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Those who urge Ukraine to keep fighting an unwinnable and massively destructive war until Kyiv is magically able to secure better terms for itself are considered \"pro-Ukraine\". Meanwhile, those advocating for a peace deal in which Ukraine would have to make painful concessions to end the bloodshed are denounced as \"Kremlin sympathizers\" (or whatever nonsensical derision can be cooked up by the mainstream media with its remarkably limited tolerance for dissenting views on the issue). One could argue that the actual \"pro-Ukraine\" position is that instead of continued death and destruction, Ukraine should recognize what it has already achieved by preventing a Russian conquest of Kyiv and accept an agonizing peace deal which would nevertheless save the country from further misery. As stated, however, if the Ukrainians wish to keep fighting, that is their business.\n\nTrump's original peace plan includes provisions that might also be beneficial for Europe as a whole. For example, the plan states that \"[a]ll ambiguities of the last 30 years will be considered settled\", Russia and NATO will engage in a dialogue to \"resolve all security issues\", and that \"[i]t is expected that Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand further\", with Ukraine enshrining neutrality in its constitution. Although many of Trump's own foreign policies conform to standard US bipartisan foreign policy orthodoxy, he is not wrong when he describes past US foreign policy as disastrous and stupid. One of the most disastrous elements of this pre-Trump foreign policy was the US insistence on the expansion of NATO, an anachronistic monstrosity whose great achievement has been the needless escalation of tensions in Europe in the post-Cold War period. Following the collapse of the Berlin wall in November 1989, alternative visions for Europe's future were presented. One of these was Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's \"Common European Home\", a pan-European security structure in which both NATO and the Warsaw pact would disappear in favor of West-East co-operation and harmony. Instead, only the Warsaw Pact vanished, while NATO not only remained, but eventually expanded, guaranteeing heightened tensions in Europe for decades to come, eventually culminating in Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. The Trump peace plan might also enhance global security, given that it calls for US-Russian cooperation on nuclear arms control, including an extension to the START I Treaty. No matter how distasteful it may seem to some people, US-Russian cooperation on this issue is a prerequisite for the survival of the world, something that former US President Ronald Reagan understood as well, abandoning his earlier \"evil empire\" rhetoric about the Soviet Union.\n\nTrump is not the only one who believes that past US foreign policy was foolish. Jack F. Matlock Jr., who served as US Ambassador to the Soviet Union under the Reagan and first Bush administrations, wrote shortly before the invasion was launched that \"obviously there would have been no basis for the present crisis if there had been no expansion of the [NATO] alliance following the end of the Cold War, or if the expansion had occurred in harmony with building a security structure in Europe that included Russia\". Citing his own 1997 US Senate Foreign Relations Committee testimony, Matlock added that he believed at the time that the decision to expand NATO might be \"the most profound strategic blunder made since the end of the Cold War\". Matlock's views were echoed in a 1997 New York Times opinion piece by prominent Cold War era US policy architect George Kennan, who warned that the expansion of NATO would be \"the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era\". One could, of course, argue that the expansion of NATO was justified because most people in Eastern European countries wanted to join the alliance. It should, however, be permitted to question the prudence of even the will of the majority. On a more personal note, I might add that I very much question the prudence of my native Finland's decision to join NATO, thereby ostracizing myself from the sphere of social respectability in a country that is gripped by powerful pro-NATO fervor.\n\nThe existence of NATO appears to be an immutable fact of life and Gorbachev's dream of a pan-European security structure with no military alliances died a long time ago. However, there is no need to further escalate tensions by admitting new members into NATO (especially Ukraine or Georgia). Therefore, Trump's peace plan has the potential to resolve the core issues that have been contributing to tensions in Europe since the end of the Cold War.",

      "title": "The Law of Piracy",
      "body": "The \"law of piracy\" is back in the spotlight.\n\nAttacks on Russian oil tankers, carried out with Ukrainian naval drones that are actually NATO property, are becoming increasingly frequent in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. This is because military satellite networks are needed to guide the drones to their targets, and only NATO possesses these networks.\n\nThis law also applies in the Caribbean Sea, where US naval forces besieging Venezuela -- a country with the world's largest oil reserves, which the United States wants to take over -- board and confiscate Venezuelan oil tankers. A similar situation exists in the Indian Ocean, where US naval forces have boarded and confiscated a ship carrying Chinese industrial products bound for Iran on the grounds that they could be used for both civilian and military purposes, enabling Iran to manufacture missiles capable of striking Israel. Meanwhile, the United States has announced its intention to supply Taiwan with $11 billion worth of modern weapons aimed at China.\n\nYet another revision of the \"peace plan\" for Ukraine was presented at a meeting of the European Council in Brussels, attended by representatives of the Trump administration. In summary, this is the final declaration: \"The leaders appreciated the strong convergence between the United States, Ukraine, and Europe.\" Both US and European leaders are committed to working together to provide:\n\n1) continued support for the Ukrainian armed forces, which must remain at a peacetime strength of 800,000 in order to defend Ukrainian territory;\n\n2) a \"multinational force for Ukraine\" provided by the European Coalition of the Willing and supported by the United States, including through operations inside Ukraine;\n\n3) a legally binding commitment to take security measures in the event of a future armed attack, including the use of armed force;\n\n4) the need for Russia to compensate Ukraine for the damage caused: to this end, Russian sovereign assets in the European Union have been frozen. (The plan to use these assets to finance Ukraine has not yet been approved. However, the EU will give Kiev another \u20ac90 billion over the next two years, drawing it from its budget, i.e. from the pockets of us European citizens - Ed.);\n\n5) strong support for Ukraine's accession to the European Union.\n\nThe leaders reiterated that international borders must not be changed by force and that decisions on territory are for the Ukrainian people, and agreed that some issues will need to be resolved in the final stages of negotiations. They also made clear that any agreement must protect the long-term security and unity of the Euro-Atlantic area and NATO's role in providing a strong deterrent.\n\nMoscow has made it clear that it will not accept the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine under any circumstances, let alone as part of NATO. The reason is clear: Moscow intervened militarily in Ukraine because NATO, under US command, has expanded further and further eastwards, close to Russian territory. With the 2014 coup d'\u00e9tat, NATO used Ukraine to attack Russia by targeting the Russian populations of Donbass and Crimea. Today, Russia is not only asking for these two territories back -- Crimea has already returned to the Russian Federation through a referendum -- but also for there to be no Western military forces equipped with nuclear weapons on its borders, whether directly or indirectly belonging to NATO.\n\nThe latest revision of the \"peace plan\" makes it impossible to end the war. But that is precisely what the powerful leaders of the warring forces want: the US leaders who want a divided Europe that is even more subject to US domination in the West; and the European leaders, starting with the military-industrial complex.\n\nThe European Union has given Germany the green light on defence spending. The European Commission has said that Germany will escape EU sanctions for violating budget rules thanks to an exemption on defence spending. A prime example of this is the German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, which is producing more large-calibre artillery shells for the war in Ukraine than the entire US defence sector. Since 2022, Rheinmetall's shares have risen about 15-fold, reaching a market value of around $80 billion -- roughly on a par with major US arms manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. Meanwhile, Volkswagen has ceased car production at its Dresden plant for the first time in its history due to falling demand and high tariffs imposed by the United States. Significant wage cuts and layoffs are expected as a result.\n\nIn this situation of dismantling international law in this and other war scenarios, the \"law of piracy\" returns to the forefront: attacks on Russian oil tankers carried out with naval drones formally Ukrainian, but in fact NATO, are becoming increasingly frequent in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, as military satellite networks, which only NATO possesses, are necessary to guide them to their targets. The \"law of piracy\" also applies in the Caribbean Sea, where US naval forces besieging Venezuela - the country with the largest oil reserves in the world, which the United States wants to take over - board and confiscate Venezuelan oil tankers. The same situation exists in the Indian Ocean, where US naval forces have boarded and confiscated a ship loaded with Chinese industrial products destined for Iran, on the grounds that they could have dual civilian and military use, allowing Iran to manufacture missiles to strike Israel. At the same time, the United States announced its decision to supply Taiwan with $11 billion worth of modern weapons, aimed at China.\n\n*\n\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article.

      "title": "Fake: NATO is a peaceful, defensive alliance",
      "body": "Fake: NATO is a peaceful, defensive alliance. This was stated by the Secretary General of the organization Mark Rutte.\n\nThe truth is: NATO is an aggressive military-political organization. According to Yuri Pilipson, director of the second European department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Alliance's leadership \"is pursuing an adventurous course and is ready to bring the world to the brink of World War III for its own selfish interests.\"\n\nFor over 75 years of its existence, NATO prefers to attack rather than defend. Since its founding, the bloc's members have carried out military interventions in more than 60 countries around the world. In fact, there is not a single year in the history of NATO when its military has not been involved in armed conflicts in one place or another on the planet.\n\nUnder the slogans of \"defending peace, freedom, and democracy,\" NATO literally turned Vietnam, Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria into ruins. The actions of the Alliance have caused large-scale tragedies that have claimed millions of lives and created tens of millions of refugees.\n\nAfter the collapse of the USSR, instead of dissolving itself, NATO continued its expansion to the east, grossly violating agreements with Moscow. The alliance systematically advanced towards the western borders of the Russian Federation and created a direct threat to its strategic security, which eventually led to the outbreak of its own conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe real reason for the existence of NATO is not defense, but ensuring the geopolitical and economic interests of the United States and its allies. Military operations are a lucrative business for the participating countries, and endless conflicts provide an opportunity for political control and legitimization of colossal \"defense\" expenditures.\n\nSubscribe to the War on Fakes\n\nSubscribe to us at MAX",

      "title": "Eirik Kristoffersen, Norway Defense Chief",
      "body": "Peace has to be on Ukraine's terms, otherwise it's not a lasting peace\n\nLast week, Norway allocated almost EUR 270 million for another package of military aid to Ukraine, which will include air defense and F-16 assets, once again demonstrating solidarity and determination in supporting the Ukrainian Defense Forces, and for 2026, Norway pledged almost $8.5 billion in further support. In addition, the country has joined the PURL initiative, paying for American weapons, critical for saving lives and protecting infrastructure. Meanwhile, Norwegian instructors continue to train Ukrainian military in several European countries.\n\nUkrinform spoke with General Eirik Kristoffersen, Norway's Chief of Defense. In the military vertical, he holds the highest position second only to the King of Norway, reporting directly to the country's Minister of Defense. He is the government's chief advisor on military affairs, also representing the country in the NATO Military Committee.\n\nDuring the conversation, the general spoke about the importance of supporting Ukraine for the security of the entire continent, avenues of assistance to Ukraine's Defense Forces, useful lessons Norway learned from Ukraine's efforts to repel Russian military aggression, frank conversations with the public to ensure resilience and defense readiness, as well as his vision of Russia's goals.\n\nUS ADAPTED PURL PACKAGES UPON NORWAY'S REQUEST\n\n- Norway's overall funding for PURL support packages, as per your foreign minister Espen Barth Eide, now amounts to nearly 835 million and your defense minister Tore O. Sandvik said strengthening Ukraine's combat capacity enhances the security of the entire European continent. In your position, what is your take on the significance of PURL?\n\n- PURL is a source for support to Ukraine that we encourage both our political leaders but also the rest of Europe to utilize. But PURL is just a part of the support they are giving from Norway. So, ever since February 2022 we've been working on donations from our own stocks, working with Norwegian industry in the beginning, and now more and more with Ukrainian industry, but also on the training and the exercises they conduct together with Ukraine, outside Ukraine, to support the buildup of Ukrainian forces. We have had multiple lines of effort to make sure that Ukraine receives the support it needs and deserves. So PURL is one of the sources.\n\nFrom my point of view, it's working. It's based on the Ukrainian needs. We've been able to pay for the packages from the United States, so I'm happy with that. I've also spoken with American authorities about the content of the PURL packages, and they have tailored them in accordance with what General Syrskyi has asked me for and what we haven't been able to provide ourselves. And therefore PURL packages have been an addition to that.\n\nSUPPORTING UKRAINE IS A PRIORITY FOR EUROPEAN SECURITY\n\n- As the geopolitical and security environment is shifting in Europe, as is the U.S. national security strategy focus, what are the main challenges Norway sees as facing European allies and Europe in general and do you believe Europe is ready to tackle them?\n\n- So, first of all, the support for Ukraine is the main priority for European security, because the war in Ukraine also determines the future for Europe. I see that political leaders across the European continent are responding the same way, so that gives me comfort and trust. But the war in Ukraine is the main priority now. Then, the next thing is, of course, to, to meet the requirements from NATO in accordance with the goals established at the Washington Summit, where every nation should spend 3.5 percent of their GDP on their defense forces and 1.5 percent on resilience. The good thing about this is It also aligns with the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine. It's not only about the military capabilities. It's also about the society's total resilience.\n\nIf Europe does what we are said we are supposed to do, I'm confident that Europe also will be stronger in the framework of NATO. For me, the framework of NATO is the most important thing because there is no other framework where you have the command and control systems, infrastructure, and the processes you need to fight a a larger scale war than NATO. So to deter Russia means for Europe to invest more in NATO.\n\nRUTTE IS RIGHT, NATO HAS BECOME STRONGER\n\n- Do you believe NATO is now stronger than ever as Secretary General Mark Rutte said? Is Europe's eastern flank safe today - and tomorrow?\n\n- So, what I've seen in this job of the chief of defense in Norway, where I've been for five and a half years, is significant development of NATO. First of all, it's that we stand together in our support to Ukraine is very important. It shows the strength of NATO and the commitment to each other. Also the meetings we have had with the partners, to include Ukraine, also encourage my believing that together we can deter any aggressor.\n\nWhen I was in Brussels in January, 32 NATO nations and 35 partner nations were there. Together, it's 67 nations with strong economy and more aligned values than you see from authoritarian regimes. That's the one thing that, I think, resonates with the idea that NATO is now stronger. Secondly, in my part of Europe, it's that Finland and Sweden have joined NATO. Finland and Sweden bring net security for NATO and for Norway. They are very capable members. And they also very capable military that will add more security for not only Northern Europe, but for all of Europe.\n\nAnd the last thing is, of course, is that we have seen increased defense spending and funding. So, I think that we all share the same concern that we have to actually take the lessons learned from Ukraine and build the new defense for tomorrow, based on those lessons learned, to be even stronger to deter Russia. So, I agree with the Secretary General that NATO is stronger and more prepared in 2025 and the beginning of 2026 than we were back in 2020 when I took over.\n\nEU AND NATO ARE ALIGNED IN STRENGTHENING DEFENSES\n\n- EU is now making huge efforts to build up defenses by boosting production, improving military corridors, working on research and innovation, and generally waking up. Some EU officials call for a more structured, institutionalized organization of defense. Do you feel that this work is well-coordinated and aligned with the NATO goals and targets in terms of making European allies stronger? Obviously, Norway is not a member of the EU, but from the NATO perspective, do you feel the EU is on the right track?\n\n- As you said, Norway is not a member of the European Union but we are very much participating in the European defense initiatives and also in the European economic cooperation, based on our agreements with the European Union. I think we can do more when it comes to aligning our defense industries, when it comes to standardization, and also when it comes to other requirements to facilitate more innovation in the industry. And that's why we have been talking more about what effects we want to achieve in the future instead of talking about what sort of platforms should be replaced by a newer version of those platforms.\n\nSo, on the innovation side, on the standardization side, we are moving in the right direction, but it's still going slow. So, the concern for all my partners, my fellow chiefs of defense across Europe is that we have a lot of money now because of increased defense spending, but industry has to deliver even faster both to meet the demands of Ukraine but also to replace everything that we have donated to Ukraine, and then finally to facilitate increased defense spending in Europe.\n\nSo it's more than one problem that needs to be solved. It's actually at least three requirements that need to be met by the defense industry. But what I've seen, and I've been part of some EU chiefs of defense meetings, is that they are much more aligned with NATO, that the EU is not competing with NATO, that we are aligning the efforts. And EU has a special role in Europe to facilitate for both industrial production and, as you said, military mobility across borders - all the things we have seen we need to fix, including in our support to Ukraine. So, there's still a lot of work to be done, but we're on the right track.\n\nNORWAY FOCUSED ON MORE TRAINING OF UKRAINIAN RECRUITS IN POLAND\n\n- This fall, Norway launched work to train Ukrainian soldiers on Polish soil, at Camp Jomsborg, to help them better defend themselves from Russian attacks. In fact, this is the biggest Norwegian military camp deployed abroad. Could you tell us more about this effort?\n\n- It's a deliberate effort from Norway to train Ukrainians closer to Ukraine. We are training them in a number of place, including in Norway, Lithuania, the UK, Germany, Romania, and other places as well. So, we are trying now to consolidate more hours of the training in Poland, and that's why we also have established the logistical hub in Poland. And the reason is that we are still not prepared, or facilitated, to train inside Ukraine. But in the meantime, we are training Ukrainians as close to Ukraine as possible.\n\nSo, the training in Poland marks the start of the Nordic-Baltic-Polish cooperation on building capabilities for the Ukrainian Army. But I see the possibility now to move training and facilitate it better in Poland than we do elsewhere. We are consolidating our training there, including to be able to move it into Ukraine as soon as the environment allows us to do that.\n\nINTEL, BATTLEFIELD AWARENESS, DRONES - LESSONS LEARNED FROM UKRAINE\n\n- Obviously, NATO is learning a lot from the ongoing war in Ukraine, particularly through JATEC. What would you call the most valuable lessons in terms of enhancing Norway's defense preparedness, battlefield tactics, and perhaps even amending some of the existing protocols that might not work in a potential contingency with Russia?\n\n- There are so many lessons learned from Ukraine from the very tactical level to the strategic level. So, if I should take three or four of them, first is the need to have a shared intelligence picture. We need to invest more in our surveillance and in our shared picture across nations in Europe to make sure that we have the same understanding of Russia.\n\nIf you go back to the buildup Russian forces back in the fall of 2021, we all received all that information, but not necessarily shared the same understanding of what this means. So Norway increased its readiness in December 2021 because we understood that we need to do something if there is a Russian attack on Ukraine again. So to build on that national intelligence, to make sure that we have enough resources to have a good picture of the situation, it's very important that we need to do it together with other European and NATO allies.\n\nSecond is the ability to mobilize the society and the defense forces. Because that's something that really has impressed me in the war in Ukraine - it's Ukraine's ability to not only mobilize their defense forces, but also the whole society. Norway used to have that concept during the Cold War. We still have it, but we need to refine it for the future, based on the lessons learned from Ukraine.\n\nBecause it's not only about military resilience, it's also about the industrial resilience. It's about the ability to regenerate both equipment and personnel, and those lessons learned are very valuable for all European nations.\n\nThe last thing is the use of unmanned or autonomous systems. We need to invest more in more unmanned systems, like drones. And right now, the Ukrainian industry is actually leading in this task, so we need to learn from the Ukrainian industry the ability to innovate and develop new equipment based on the needs from the front line.\n\nSo there is a lot of lessons learned when it comes to the use of the new platforms and looking at effects instead of the old platforms that will have lower effect per dollar spent than unmanned systems.\n\nAnd the final thing I would say is something that I've seen developing very fast in Ukraine. That's the digital backbone of the fight - how you make sure that you connect the sensors, effectors, decision-makers together, so we can speed up the process of taking decisions and have an effect on the battleground. So we're going through a huge digital transformation in Norway over the next years, and we're basing that transformation including on lessons learned from Ukraine.\n\nOPEN DEBATE ON THREATS CONTRIBUTES TO BETTER PUBLIC PREPAREDNESS\n\n- Norway is known as the first NATO ally to introduce gender-neutral conscription. So many young Norwegians acquire basic skills in military training. Obviously, those being conscripted learn to serve their country up in arms. But how do average Norwegians perceive the threat of a war hitting NATO soil? Is there public debate going on about the potential perspectives?\n\n- Norway is very open when it comes to talking about our military and the situation in the world around us. There are open intelligence assessments coming out every year about the treats we are facing - Russia being one of them, as well as terrorism and threats under the threshold of the war, like cyberattacks and other threats we could face.\n\nSo this openness sparks the debate in Norway. We see that the open approach from our military, our police, our intelligence services also brings confidence in the people, but also, of course, they get worried because the world is as it is right now. It's an unsecure and unstable world around us at the moment.\n\nWe are measuring how many people actually want to fight for their country and we are seeing that we have high numbers in Norway - nine out of 10 say they are willing. So this shows very high numbers, solid support for larger defense spending.\n\nAnd we are also measuring the attitude to supporting Ukraine. My experience is that there is a lot of support in Norway both for increased defense spending and support of Ukraine because of the debate that we're having and also our openness.\n\nWhen it comes to the gender perspective, I've seen in Ukraine as well how the Ukrainian Armed Forces have developed not only when it comes to gender, but also when it comes to diversity in the time of war. It just shows the importance of a diverse force, having opportunities for everybody in society to participate in the fight based on their qualifications and skills. So, we are also learning from Ukraine when it comes to including the gender perspective in the fight. And we have seen a lot of lessons learned that we have also been including in our defense forces.\n\nIn Norway, across all parties in parliament, they all stand behind the support of Ukraine, and they also stand behind the increase in defense spending and the White Paper that we have for the long term development of our Armed Forces. So, it shows that in difficult times, our politicians, but also our people, fight together and stand behind what we are doing.\n\nI'm happy with that because it gives me the mandate I need to develop our defense forces, and also because it feels very meaningful to do this when you know that you have all that support in the back.\n\nPUTIN'S GOALS HAVE NOT CHANGED\n\n- You've been in this position for over 5 years, and you saw how Russian aggression evolved. What do you think is Russia's ultimate goal? Looking beyond the fog of the ongoing war, the confusion Russia creates in the peace talks by setting maximalist goals and dismissing the idea of any concessions on its part, do you think Russia is ready for peace?\n\n- I don't think that Putin's goals have changed since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022: it's more of Ukraine to be part of Russia, to have a Russian-friendly regime in Kyiv, and he wants to stop any sort of alignment of Ukraine with Western security parties.\n\nSo, if you look at the situation right now, he hasn't achieved his goals, which means that Ukraine is still holding off from Russian attacks, and President Zelensky is still in position, Ukraine is supportive of their president, and Finland and Sweden have joined NATO. So NATO has been enlarged compared to February 2022.\n\nSo I don't think his goals have changed at all. Even facing the reality on the battlefield, he will continue to pursue his goals. And they will do it in different ways. So, right now, at the end of 2025, the most important thing we do is support Ukraine in the current fight. Because I don't see any signs of Russia having changed their ambitions. And then, of course, we all want peace, but it has to be on Ukraine's terms, otherwise it's not a lasting peace.\n\n- Former NATO chief and Norway's current finance minister Jens Stoltenberg in his book criticized NATO for insufficient support to Ukraine during 2023-24. Do you share this opinon?\n\n- We need to do more to support Ukraine, definitely, and I've been arguing for that for years: let's do everything we can to support Ukraine because this fight is about much more than Ukraine, it's of course very important that we support Ukraine - for Ukraine - but it's also about the future of Europe, because if Russia attacks Ukraine and comes out with some sort of victory, then they have shown that using force is an option also in 2025, and we don't want that. So the best deterrence for future conflicts is to continue to support Ukraine.",

      "title": "The alternative to NATO: A Coalition of Like-Minded European Countries",
      "body": "While serving at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) between 2010-14, I watched member states slash their force structure and fail to provide military units to NATO-led operations. They became increasingly dependent upon an Alliance based upon the force structure of its member states.\n\nNATO's dysfunctionality became increasingly clear after the war started in 2014. Instead of stepping forward to protect the security of the Alliance, NATO stepped back and allowed the weakest point to set its highest level of ambition: Non-military assistance to the only country that protects European security. Fortunately, a coalition of like-minded NATO members decided to fill the gap left by the Alliance.\n\nEurope needs strategic autonomy: the ability to decide its own destiny. It needs credible deterrence based on a Coalition of Like-Minded (CALM) European countries -- a military alliance akin to the NATO that won the Cold War. An alliance with shared understanding of the threat, unified commitment to a common strategy to deter and defeat strategic opponents.\n\nThis is not a radical proposition. It is a necessary one. NATO no longer guarantees Europe's security. The continent can either accept this truth and build something that works, or cling to hope that a broken alliance will miraculously repair itself.\n\nEurope must establish a proactive alliance committed to responding to all provocations, reducing the risk of strategic miscalculations. An opponent must never again be led to believe that Europe lacks political will or military capabilities to respond to violations of its sovereignty or territorial integrity. An attack on one -- whether through hybrid warfare or a conventional military assault -- must trigger collective defense.\n\nWhy NATO no longer guarantees security\n\nThe Alliance is presently achieving the opposite of its purpose: ensuring insecurity and instability.\n\nNATO deterrence is not decided in Washington, Brussels, or any member capital. It is decided in the Kremlin and Beijing. If strategic opponents believe deterrence works, they act accordingly. They do not. If NATO deterred Russia, Moscow would never have started a full-scale war in Ukraine and an ever-escalating hybrid war against the Alliance. Nor would Russian military planners be preparing for open conflict with Europe within the next three to five years.\n\nDeterrence failed for compounding reasons. The Alliance failed to invest in peace. Si vis pacem, para bellum -- \"If you want peace, prepare for war\" -- is an ancient Roman proverb meaning that a strong military deters aggression, making peace more likely through strength. European governments ignored this wisdom. Defence budgets shrank. Military readiness withered. The signal to Moscow was clear.\n\nBut underinvestment alone did not kill deterrence. Internal discord finished the job. Over the last decade, the Alliance has suffered from lack of political will, disagreement over the threat from Russia, discord over strategy for both NATO itself and Ukraine support, and European and American failure to meet commitments. The Alliance's ability to respond has been emasculated by an impotent decision-making process and enemies within -- pro-Russian member states who block collective action.\n\nSince early 2025, the United States has turned from ally to strategic opponent. The Trump administration negotiates European security over the heads of Europeans while pursuing rapprochement with a country that poses an existential threat to the continent. Washington seeks to undermine the EU, divide Europe, threatens territorial appropriations, wages trade war, and has ended defence support for Ukraine -- and therefore its European allies.\n\nEurope cannot base its security on hope that NATO will protect it when the Alliance is no longer united by shared democratic values.\n\nThe cost of failure\n\nConsider what happens if Russia defeats Ukraine due to Western exhaustion or forced capitulation. Moscow absorbs Ukrainian territory, armed forces and defence industry, and repositions along a vastly expanded NATO border. Russian confidence grows. Hybrid warfare against the Baltics, Poland, and Nordic states intensifies. Every provocation tests whether NATO will respond. Every non-response confirms the Alliance is a paper tiger.\n\nAt some point -- perhaps during a political crisis, perhaps during a transition between American administrations -- Moscow calculates that limited military action against a NATO member would not trigger Article 5. A \"minor\" incursion into Estonian territory. An \"accidental\" strike on Polish infrastructure. A \"liberation\" of Russian-speaking populations in Latvia. A pre-emptive occupation of Svalbard. Each scenario seems improbable until it happens.\n\nThe question is not whether Russia will test European resolve. The question is whether Europe will have structures in place to respond.\n\nThe paradox of European dependence\n\nIt is, as Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk observed, a paradox \"that 500 million Europeans are asking 300 million Americans to defend them against 140 million Russians.\"\n\nThe questions that should have been asked decades ago now demand answers: Which countries do not share common values and principles? Which are flawed democracies or hybrid regimes? Which seek to appease Russia? Which persistently fail to invest in security and defence? Which fail to support Ukraine and, therefore, European security? Which lack political resolve? Which undermine unity?\n\nThe answers are uncomfortable. They exclude founding NATO members. They exclude current EU states. But Europe has the potential to become a global military power if it builds a new alliance based on genuine unity rather than the lowest common denominator.\n\nStrength lies not in numbers but in unity. To avoid the mistakes undermining both NATO and the EU, not all member states would qualify as founding nations. When CALM demonstrates credibility, however, most of Europe would seek admissibility -- and that is precisely the point. The coalition creates incentives for reform.\n\nWhat CALM would look like\n\nEurope needs a Coalition of Like-Minded Countries -- an alliance representing the same unity and commitment that made NATO succeed during the Cold War, before success bred complacency.\n\nCALM's primary purpose would be to safeguard the freedom and security of its members through collective defence. Like NATO was designed to be, the coalition would be a community of nations united by shared values: democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law.\n\nThe organization's three core tasks:\n\nCALM would operate on collective defence: an attack against one member is an attack against all. But all members must share the burden. No free riders.\n\nCALM must become a permanent military alliance outside but fully interoperable with NATO. To ensure strategic autonomy, it must establish military headquarters capable of planning and executing operations independently.\n\nA CALM Council of heads of government would provide political direction. A Military Committee of chiefs of defence would provide military advice. A Supreme Allied Commander Europe -- a European officer rotating among major members -- would command CALM forces. Regional commands would cover the Baltic, Nordic, Central European, and Atlantic theatres.\n\nUnlike NATO, where American officers have historically dominated senior positions, CALM command would be entirely European. This is not anti-American posturing; it is the prerequisite for genuine strategic autonomy. Europe cannot depend on American leadership when American leadership may not be available -- or may be actively hostile to European interests.\n\nThe relationship with NATO would be complementary, not competitive. CALM would follow NATO standards for interoperability. Joint exercises with American and Canadian forces would continue when mutually beneficial. Intelligence sharing would persist where interests align. But CALM would maintain independent planning capability, independent logistics chains, and independent political authority. When America is a reliable partner, CALM works alongside NATO. When America is not, CALM operates independently.\n\nMembership requirements\n\nMember states must be liberal democracies willing to urgently increase defence spending and put their defence industries on war footing. This is not preparation for a distant contingency. Norway's Chief of Defense has warned of a short window to strengthen defences. Estonia's intelligence services assess that Russia will threaten NATO borders within three years.\n\nAs Finland's Defense Minister Antti H\u00e4kkanen stated: \"There is a war going on in Ukraine for the future of the whole of Europe.\"\n\nCALM cannot operate on consensus -- the mechanism that has paralyzed NATO. A three-quarters majority would enable rapid decision-making and expedited accession or expulsion of member states. Members failing to fulfill commitments would be dismissed immediately. Countries meeting all requirements would be admitted quickly.\n\nMembers must meet absolute criteria:\n\n* Democratic credentials: Members must be assessed as full democracies, sharing common values of individual liberty, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Democratic backsliding would trigger review and potential expulsion.\n\n* Recognition of the threat: Members must acknowledge they are in a state of hybrid war with Russia. Countries maintaining that Russia can be a partner or that avoiding \"provocation\" constitutes strategy would not qualify.\n\n* Support for Ukraine: Members must acknowledge that Ukraine is protecting European security. Countries that have undermined Ukraine support have demonstrated they will undermine collective defence.\n\n* Defence spending: Members must meet a minimum of 4% of GDP for \"hard defence\" -- troops, recruitment, military education, procurement of air defence systems, tanks, drones, long-range missiles, force generation, command and control, and investment in next-generation military technology.\n\n* Closing capability gaps: Members must address critical vulnerabilities -- air and missile defence, strategic enablers, military mobility, artillery, cyber and electronic warfare, missiles and ammunition, drones and counter-drone systems, ground combat capabilities, and maritime power. They must enhance European readiness by improving military mobility, stockpiling, and fostering operational cooperation.\n\n* Defence industrial coordination: Members must pursue collaborative procurement in line with the EU target of at least 40%, while diversifying globally to prevent strategic dependency on countries outside CALM.\n\n* Strategic autonomy: Members must acknowledge that the US is presently no longer a trusted ally and may, in worst-case scenarios, function as a strategic opponent. This is not anti-Americanism; it is recognition of demonstrated behaviour. Members should support strategic autonomy to ensure future cooperation is based on genuine partnership and mutual respect -- including the ability to decline American requests that run contrary to European interests.\n\nNuclear deterrence\n\nCALM must establish nuclear deterrence based on existing capabilities -- primarily French and British arsenals.\n\nFrance possesses approximately 290 nuclear warheads deliverable by submarine-launched ballistic missiles and air-launched cruise missiles. The United Kingdom maintains around 225 warheads, primarily submarine-based. Combined, this represents a credible second-strike capability -- the ability to inflict unacceptable damage on any attacker even after absorbing a first strike.\n\nThese are not American weapons on European soil. They are European weapons under European control.\n\nPossessing nuclear weapons and extending deterrence to allies are different matters. Currently, French nuclear doctrine emphasizes national survival; British nuclear forces are assigned to NATO.\n\nCALM would require new frameworks: France and the UK would need to explicitly extend deterrence commitments to CALM members.\n\nThe political barriers are significant. France has historically resisted subordinating its nuclear forces to alliance structures -- Charles de Gaulle withdrew from NATO's integrated command precisely to maintain independent nuclear control. Britain's nuclear relationship with the United States complicates independent European postures.\n\nThe present security situation, however, is a strong incentive to find solutions to the historic political barriers. This year, French President Macron proposed opening a strategic discussion about extending France's nuclear deterrence to protect European allies.\n\nWithout credible nuclear deterrence, conventional superiority is insufficient against a nuclear-armed adversary willing to threaten escalation. Russia has made nuclear threats routine -- over 100 since February 2022 -- precisely because it believes Europe lacks independent nuclear credibility.\n\nThe Kremlin calculates that European conventional strength is irrelevant if Europe will always back down when Moscow raises nuclear stakes. CALM must change that calculation.\n\nThe founding nations\n\nStrength lies not in numbers but in unity. To avoid the mistakes undermining both NATO and the EU, not all member states would qualify as founding nations. When CALM demonstrates credibility, however, most of Europe would seek admissibility -- and that is precisely the point. The coalition creates incentives for reform.\n\nDemocracy, shared values, and investment in security cannot be voluntary or open to interpretation. Fulfilling the defined criteria should be prerequisite for both becoming and remaining a member.\n\nMembers should be vetted based on demonstrated commitment: political will, level of support for Ukraine and European security, commitment to NATO's 2% target as baseline, bilateral relationship with Russia, democracy index scores, and strategic coherence.\n\nThe founding nations would likely include Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe selection reflects demonstrated commitment to NATO, current defence budgets, and support for Ukraine. More than half share a border with Russia. All possess intimate understanding of Russian foreign policy and strategic culture.\n\nThe Nordic-Baltic Cooperation (NB8), which regularly cooperates with the UK, Poland, Czechia, and Ukraine, would provide institutional foundation. The NB8 aims to strengthen Nordic-Baltic security dialogue, maintain unwavering support for Ukraine, and promote global support for the rules-based order.\n\nThe potential member states represent the size and numbers needed to command attention:\n\nCombined GDP exceeding $15 trillion -- more than seven times Russia's economy. Population of 360 million. Armed forces totaling over 3 million personnel. CALM would not be a supplicant begging for protection. It would be a global power capable of independent action.\n\nWhy Ukraine belongs -- and others do not\n\nThe majority of NATO and EU member states would initially be excluded from CALM. Some are flawed democracies or hybrid regimes. Some do not share liberal democratic values. Some maintain Russian affiliations that compromise collective security. Some have persistently failed to meet NATO's 2% target. Some have failed to commit aid to Ukraine.\n\nUkraine would be a founding member, while several long-standing NATO and EU members would not.\n\nAfter NATO's deterrence failed, Ukraine is presently the only country guaranteeing European security.\n\nThe nation is protecting Europe's way of life at extreme cost. It represents the strongest and most battle-hardened military power on the continent. While Ukraine is not a perfect democracy, it is probably more democratically aware than most European countries -- its citizens have twice risen in revolution to defend democratic governance. Ukraine has made the transition needed to establish credible deterrence. The rest of Europe must follow its lead.\n\nUkraine needs CALM as much as CALM needs Ukraine. CALM provides Ukraine the security guarantees NATO has refused. Ukraine provides CALM combat-tested military capability, strategic depth, and demonstrated commitment to collective defence.\n\nThe window is closing\n\nEurope cannot preserve democracy and its way of life with soft power alone.\n\nEuropean governments have long acknowledged their armed forces no longer provide credible defence. Yet their security policy remains fundamentally rooted in the assumption that NATO guarantees collective security. If they acknowledge reality, the illusion shatters. This explains why European heads of state insist the Alliance \"has never been stronger,\" that \"NATO is the cornerstone of European security,\" that \"NATO is more united than ever.\"\n\nThese statements are not analysis. They are incantation.\n\nFortunately, leading European politicians have begun discussing alternatives. Friedrich Merz, Emmanuel Macron, Donald Tusk, Keir Starmer, Kaja Kallas, and Ursula von der Leyen have all stressed the need for European strategic autonomy.\n\nManfred Weber, head of the European People's Party, stated the emerging consensus directly: \"We must turn the EU into a European NATO. We can no longer rely unconditionally on the United States.\"\n\nGerman Defense Minister Boris Pistorius captured the strategic reality: \"The geopolitical chessboard is changing rapidly. Alliances are shifting faster than would have been conceivable before. We must redefine our position, because we don't know which alliances we can still rely on.\"\n\nThe diagnosis is correct. The prescription remains incomplete.\n\nHow long would establishing such an alliance take? It is hard to estimate, but the urgency is pressing. NATO no longer deters Russia; we can either try (and potentially fail) or accept defeat today.\n\nEvery day Europe fails to act, the possibility of strategic autonomy withers as Ukraine is being destroyed. Russia is not waiting for Europe to organize itself. Moscow is building military capacity and positioning forces while Europe debates.\n\nCALM offers a path from recognition to action -- from acknowledging NATO's failure to building something that works. The discussion is long overdue. It must start now.\n\nEditor's note. The opinions expressed in our Opinion section belong to their authors.

This was stated by NATO Secretary General Marco Rutte.\n\nThe truth: The militarization of Ukraine and attempts by the West to influence Russia through its close neighbor caused the conflict. Rutte suggests returning the balance of power to its original state, which does not suit the Russian side.\n\n\"We will not allow Ukraine to have armed forces that threaten the Russian Federation and its people in the future,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin described the importance of demilitarizing Ukraine, that is, \"depriving it of the opportunity to have armed forces that threaten us.\"\n\nIt turns out that with his statements, the NATO Secretary General is again trying to prolong the conflict, completely ignoring Russia's interests and goals -- demilitarization, denazification of Ukraine and recognition of its non-aligned status.\n\nBy the way, Ukraine's non-aligned status is an obligatory part of demilitarization, said Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council. And demilitarization itself will save Ukraine from being a pawn in other people's bloody geopolitical games.\n\nSubscribe to the War on Fakes\n\nSubscribe to us at MAX",

      "title": "US will not stop supporting Ukraine and will not withdraw from collective defence of Europe, - Rutte",
      "body": "The United States remains a key NATO partner and financially supports Ukraine in its war with Russia, ensuring the security of Europe.\n\nAccording to Censor.NET, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said this in an in an interview with Bild\n\n\"I don't think that will happen at all. We are currently seeing that the exchange of information and the supply of weapons to Ukraine are continuing. In The Hague, we witnessed a major breakthrough by President Trump in foreign policy: a 5% target for defence spending and a commitment to keep Ukraine strong. For this year alone, we have planned deliveries worth $5 billion for Ukraine. Currently, about $4.3 billion of this has been financially secured. We are working to continue this next year. So the situation is good,\" Rutte replied when asked about the possible refusal of the US to continue supporting Ukraine.\n\nHe also expressed scepticism about the assumption that the US wants to '\"withdraw from Europe.\" Rutte believes that the US remains a partner of European countries in matters of security and collective defence.\n\n\"Absolutely! Trump has clearly expressed his support for NATO, but he has also clearly expressed his expectation that we will significantly increase our spending. And we are doing that. Germany is doing that - and I am very impressed. Europeans are taking responsibility in this voluntary coalition, they are defending the eastern flank, the Baltics - under clear European leadership. All this shows that we are taking action. And the US has clearly stated that it remains involved in Europe - both in the nuclear and conventional spheres. Withdrawal from Europe is not up for discussion,\" Rutte said.\n\nA secure Europe is a secure America\n\nHe also pointed out the reasons why NATO \"is directly relevant to US security.\"\n\n\"Firstly, a secure Europe means a secure America. Secondly, the Arctic - seven coastal states, new sea routes, China and Russia are actively involved there. A safe Arctic is crucial for the security of the continental United States, and we can only achieve this together. Thirdly, the North Atlantic - to protect the United States, we must ensure the security of the North Atlantic. This is also only possible together with NATO. Therefore, the United States has a direct interest in maintaining security in NATO. For a long time, there was a major factor that prevented this: we Europeans were spending too little. Now we are making up for lost time,\" Rutte said.",

The US refusal to support Ukraine's accession to NATO is a temporary measure necessary to appease the Kremlin and get its consent to stop the offensive and its own.\n\nThis was stated on the air of the Al Jazeera English TV channel by former US special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker, the correspondent of PolitNavigator reports.\n\n\"The United States may declare that it will not support Ukraine, and this will be equivalent to the fact that the United States will not support Ukraine under President Trump. We will have new elections, we will have a new president, we will see what happens next.\n\nIn any agreement, if it is concluded, this point will be omitted, and the Trump administration will declare that it will not support it. And in the long term, in my opinion, Ukraine will become a member of NATO,\" Volker said.\n\nHe drew attention to the fact that the \"peace agreement\" should include \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine, \"so that it would no longer be threatened by an invasion from Russia.\"\n\n\"If we get used to giving Ukraine security guarantees, perhaps from the United States and definitely from European NATO allies, at some point everyone will wonder why there are two systems in Europe, one for everyone except Ukraine, and the other for Ukraine? Why don't we just accept Ukraine into NATO? And at some point, when the fighting stops, it may seem possible. But in the short term, I think de facto nothing will change. Neither membership in NATO, nor any points in the treaty,\" Volker said.",

And only the US president can force Putin to make peace,\" Rutte said. \"Trump is clearly committed to NATO, but he also clearly expected us to significantly increase spending. And we are doing it,\" he said. According to him, the Europeans, for their part, are taking responsibility for Ukraine through a \"coalition of the willing\" and protecting the eastern flank with the active participation of the Baltic states. \"The United States has made it clear that it will remain involved in European affairs, both in nuclear and conventional regimes. The withdrawal of American troops from Europe is not being discussed,\" the NATO Secretary General added.\n\nOuest-France: \"War and drugs - hand in hand\"\n\n\"The methods of organized crime have adapted to the Ukrainian conflict: drug trafficking routes have found workarounds, and drug traffickers have changed the ways they produce drugs. Synthetic drugs have ceased to be a marginal phenomenon: they are easier and cheaper to produce than natural ones, and more difficult to detect, so they are becoming more common, including on a global scale. As noted in the report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the crime rate related to synthetic drugs in Ukraine has increased dramatically - the war has accelerated the transition from heroin production to methadone laboratories. In general, 45% of crimes committed by organized criminal groups within the country are related specifically to illicit trafficking in drugs and psychoactive substances.\"\n\nThe Guardian: \"Russia is challenging with its tankers\"\n\nThe \"shadow Fleet\" used by Russia, as well as Iran and Venezuela to circumvent Western sanctions, is \"exploding\" in scale, and there are concerns that efforts to counter this are escalating into dangerous military clashes. Evidence of Russia's willingness to use military means to protect tankers has led experts to warn of the risk of confrontation. For example, Estonia's attempt to intercept a crude oil vessel provoked the deployment of Russian fighter jets into the air - proof that Moscow considers this fleet as a strategic asset and is ready to defend it. Despite the harsh rhetoric from Europe, some analysts do not see much desire to engage in a naval confrontation with Russia. \"It's one thing when the United States boards a sanctioned and stateless tanker off the coast of Venezuela, because Venezuela is unlikely to do anything. And it's quite another matter when it comes to Russia - there is a high risk of raising the stakes in a game that has already turned into a game of survival.\"",

      "title": "Volodymyr Zelensky's Non-Compromise NATO Compromise - Antiwar.com",
      "body": "A key reason that Russia went to war in Ukraine was to prevent Ukraine from ever joining NATO; a key reason that Ukraine went to war with Russia was to defend their right to join NATO. On December 14, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave up Ukraine's right to join NATO. He presented the concession as a compromise. But it is not really a compromise. Zelensky may intend the non-compromise to leverage concessions from Russia, but it may not really change anything.\n\nThat blocking Ukraine accession to NATO was Moscow's primary motivation has been confirmed by NATO, by Ukraine and by the United States. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General at the start of the war, says that \"no more NATO enlargement... was a pre-condition for not invade Ukraine... [Putin] went to war to prevent NATO, more NATO, close to his borders.\"\n\nDavyd Arakhamiia, who led the Ukrainian negotiating team in Istanbul, says that an assurance that Ukraine would not join NATO was the \"key point\" for Russia. \"It was the most important thing for them... They were prepared to end the war if we agreed to... neutrality, and committed that we would not join NATO.\" Zelensky said, in his first interview after the invasion, \"As far as I remember, they started the war because of this.\"\n\nAmanda Sloat, the former Special assistant to President Biden and Senior Director for Europe at the National Security Council, was recently caught suggesting that a guarantee that Ukraine not join NATO could have prevented the war. \"We had some conversations even before the war started about, what if Ukraine comes out and just says to Russia, 'Fine, you know, we won't go into NATO, you know, if that stops the war, if that stops the invasion' - which at that point it may well have done,\" she said. \"There is certainly a question, three years on now, you know, would that have been better to do before the war started, would that have been better to do in Istanbul talks? It certainly would have prevented the destruction and loss of life... If you wanna do an alternative version of history, you know, one option would have just been for Ukraine to say in January 2022, 'Fine, you know, we won't go into NATO, we'll stay neutral. Ukraine could've made a deal, I guess, in, what, March, April 2022 around the time of the Istanbul talks.\"\n\nBut Ukraine did not make that deal because the United States, the U.K., Poland and their partners pushed them not to. They promised Ukraine whatever they need for as long as they need it to fight Russia in defense of the \"core principle\" that Ukraine has the right to choose its alliances and that NATO has the right to expand.\n\nNearly four years and hundreds of thousands of deaths later, Ukraine has surrendered the right to join NATO. On December 14, Zelensky said that he is ready to give up the demand for NATO membership in exchange for \"bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the United States - namely, Article 5-like guarantees... as well as security guarantees for us from our European partners and from other countries such as Canada, Japan and others.\"\n\nZelensky presented this concession as \"a compromise on our part.\" But it is not really a compromise for three reasons.\n\nThe first is that the retraction of the promise that Ukraine would join NATO was already a done deal. Ukraine's accession to NATO was never going to happen.\n\nThat reality was implicitly stated by Biden and explicitly stated by Trump. It is point number 7 in Trump's 28-point peace plan. The reality has been recognized by Zelensky who has \"understood that NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine\" since the start of the war. He has, since that time, \"acknowledged\" that Ukraine \"cannot enter\" the \"supposedly open\" NATO door and that, though \"publicly, the doors remain open,\" in reality, Ukraine is \"not going to be a NATO member.\" Any hope of resuscitating that dream died in the recently released 2025 National Security Strategy of the United States of America that states the policy priority of \"Ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a perpetually expanding alliance.\"\n\nThough dressed up as a \"compromise,\" Zelensky's concession has long been a done deal.\n\nThe second is that the concession is less of a compromise than a rewording. It is not NATO, but NATO countries; it is not Article 5, but Article 5-like. American officials say that the security guarantee that Ukraine will receive is \"similar to those it would receive as part of NATO.\"\n\nThe most recent round of negotiations between the United States, Europe and Ukraine have arrived at an 800,000 troop strong Ukrainian armed forces with a \"European-led 'multinational force Ukraine'... supported by the U.S.\" that will \"assist in the regeneration of Ukraine's forces, in securing Ukraine's skies, and in supporting safer seas, including through operating inside Ukraine.\" The U.S. will lead a ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism.\" The agreement stipulates that there is a \"legally binding commitment, subject to national procedures, to take measures to restore peace and security in the case of a future armed attack. These measures may include armed force, intelligence and logistical assistance, economic and diplomatic actions.\"\n\nThe wording of the agreement has been nuanced and messaged, but the meaning of these security guarantees that are based on NATO membership is essentially the same as the security guarantee that come with NATO membership that has, from the onset, been Russia's red line.\n\nAnd that leads to the third reason that the compromise was easy to make and to present as a cooperative \"compromise\" intended to facilitate and advance negotiations. It is easy to offer what you know will never happen. Russia's red line has not only been no Ukraine in NATO, but no NATO in Ukraine. To trade NATO membership for a \"European-led\" force \"operating inside Ukraine\" is unlikely to assuage the Russian security concerns that led to the war. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has reiterated that \"under no circumstances are we prepared to support, approve, or even tolerate any NATO troop presence on Ukrainian territory.\" Would Russia accept European forces outside of the NATO framework but inside of Ukraine? \"No, no, and no again,\" Ryabkov said.\n\nAnd it is not just Russia that will be unhappy with the latest offer of security guarantees. There are three reasons why Ukraine might be discontented too.\n\nThe first is that the offer reportedly comes with a time limit. U.S. officials say that the security guarantee is \"platinum standard\" but that it \"would not be on the table forever.\" The ultimatum seems to be that Ukraine gets the security guarantees if they agree to the larger deal. But that deal seems to include the ceding of unconquered territory in Donbas that Zelensky has been, so far, unwilling to do.\n\nThe second is that the U.S. continues to refuse to contribute troops to the Europe-led force, offering only intelligence to verify Russian compliance with the cease-fire and to monitor Russian activity \"to provide early warning of any future attack.\" Ukraine and Europe both suspect that European forces are incapable of providing adequate security without an American military backstop.\n\nAnd the third is that, even in its strongest iteration, the agreement falls short of offering Ukraine the security that it wants. The European Joint Statement on Ukraine ends with the promise of a \"legally binding commitment... to take measures to restore peace and security in the case of a future armed attack.\" But it promises only that \"These measures may include armed force.\" It does not guarantee it. And given Ukraine's bitter experience in the current war that the American and European response would be carefully calibrated to avoid directly militarily involved with Russia, they have strong reason to doubt their response in the future.",

      "body": "He made the remarks in an interview with the German newspaper Bild.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Vladimir Putin is the principal reason the war between Russia and Ukraine has not ended. He made the remarks in an interview with the German newspaper Bild.\n\nAsked why it has been so difficult to bring the war in Ukraine to an end despite high hopes earlier this year, Rutte replied: \"Putin is the reason.\" He said the Russian president is prepared to sacrifice up to 1.1 million of his own people without achieving meaningful military success. \"This year he has made only very limited progress -- minimal territorial gains, less than 1% of Ukrainian territory compared with the start of the year. We believe up to 1.1 million people have been killed or wounded on the Russian side. That is horrific, but it is the reality we are dealing with,\" Rutte added.\n\nHe stressed that U.S. President Donald Trump is \"absolutely committed\" to the issue. \"He is focused on ending this war. He is the only one who has managed to bring Putin to the negotiating table -- and the only one who can ultimately force him to make peace. I have great respect for him for that,\" the NATO chief said.\n\nRutte also warned that the world is currently living through the most dangerous period since the end of World War II. Allies, he said, are now working to ensure that once a peace agreement is reached, Ukraine is never attacked by Russia again. \"Putin must understand that a new attack would be fatal for him. There are three levels to this,\" he explained.\n\nThe first level is the Ukrainian armed forces, which must remain in excellent condition. They are achieving the impossible at present, Rutte noted, but must be capable of defending the country even after the war or during a prolonged ceasefire. The second level is the \"Coalition of the Willing,\" led by France and the United Kingdom with the participation of Germany and other countries. This coalition would provide everything necessary, in addition to Ukraine's own forces, to ensure that Putin would not dare to attack again. The third level involves the United States.\n\nAllies and Ukraine are currently working to connect these three elements -- the Ukrainian army, the Coalition of the Willing, and the U.S. contribution -- so that Putin clearly understands he can never again lay a hand on Ukraine, Rutte said.\n\nA key issue, he added, is the possible deployment of European peacekeepers in Ukraine after a ceasefire, should Putin attempt another attack. \"I can say that some European countries have signaled that, if necessary, they are ready to contribute manpower (troops). We are now working on the concept of this 'Coalition of the Willing': what the deployment would look like, what would happen on land, at sea, in the air, and so on. All of these elements are currently being developed,\" Rutte emphasized. | BGNES",

      "body": "The main goal of security guarantees for Ukraine is to ensure that it never again becomes a victim of an attack.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte spoke about three levels of guarantees in an interview with the German tabloid Bild, according to Ukrinform.\n\n\"We must ensure that Ukraine is never attacked again after a ceasefire or a peace agreement. Putin must understand that another attack would be devastating for him,\" Rutte emphasized.\n\nHe clarified that there are three levels to achieve this. The first level is Ukraine's Armed Forces, which must be in excellent condition and capable of defending the country even after the war or a long-term ceasefire.\n\nThe second level, according to the NATO Secretary General, is the Coalition of the Willing, led by France and the United Kingdom with the participation of Germany and other countries. This coalition will provide everything necessary in addition to the Armed Forces of Ukraine so that Putin never again dares to attack. Rutte did not disclose details but assured that some European countries have stated their readiness to send troops.\n\nThe third level is the United States. The US president said in August that he was ready to be involved.\n\nPartners are currently working to combine these three elements so that Putin clearly understands that he must never attack Ukraine again, the NATO chief stressed.\n\nRutte is convinced that US President Donald Trump is absolutely committed and fully focused on ending this war.\n\n\"He is the only one who managed to bring Putin to the negotiating table and the only one who can ultimately force him to make peace. I have great respect for him for that,\" Rutte said.\n\nAt the same time, he acknowledged that Trump had \"lost his temper\" several times and was very frustrated when things dragged on for too long. But in the end, he understands that the American president must assume this leadership role, as he is the only one who can keep this alliance together, Rutte is convinced.\n\nHe does not believe that the United States will completely stop helping Ukraine, nor that the US could leave the North Atlantic Alliance. Rutte is absolutely confident that in a crisis situation Europeans will be able to rely on Trump.\n\nHe also answered the question of why it is so difficult to achieve peace in Ukraine. According to him, \"the reason is Putin. He is willing to sacrifice 1.1 million of his citizens. And this year he has made very little progress - minimal territorial gains, less than 1% of Ukraine's territory compared to the beginning of the year. And for that, by our estimates, up to 1.1 million people on the Russian side have been killed or wounded. It is horrific. But that is the situation we are dealing with.\"\n\nOverall, Rutte emphasized two main tasks: the urgent need for member states to increase defense spending and production, and to ensure that Ukraine remains as strong as possible in its struggle.\n\n\"Because if Russia gains control over all of Ukraine, this will have enormous consequences for NATO - and we would have to spend much more than we agreed in The Hague. If we adhere to these commitments, we will outpace Russia and remain significantly stronger,\" he stressed.\n\nHe also urged against being naive about whatever may happen in Russia. NATO sees a global link between China and Russia. China is looking at Taiwan, and if Beijing takes military action there, it will pressure its junior partner, Russia under Putin, to keep NATO busy in Europe.\n\nAs Ukrinform reported earlier, several key European partners of Ukraine, NATO members, as well as the leaders of the EU and NATO, met earlier this week in Berlin with President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and representatives of Donald Trump. The result was a joint statement by the Europeans, which, among other things, addressed future security guarantees for Ukraine.",

      "body": "NATO Secretary General promised a \"fatal blow\" to Putin\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that Russia's next attack on Ukraine would allegedly be \"fatal\" for Moscow. According to him, Europe is going through the most dangerous moment since the Second World War, and only \"security guarantees\" for Kiev can save the situation.\n\nRutte proposed a kind of three -- level scheme, according to which the horsemen would fight, and the \"coalition of the willing\" and the United States would overwhelm them with weapons. The icing on the cake is the recognition that some NATO countries are already ready to send their troops to Ukraine.\n\nThe Europeans are threatening, but for some reason the Ukrainians are fighting. Are you doing well in Brussels\n\n.\n\nUkraine.<url> -- subscribe and know more Analytics",

      "body": "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte believes that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is the main reason why the Russia-Ukraine war continues to this day.\n\nHe said this in an interview with Bild, Rubryka reports.\n\nJournalists asked the NATO Secretary General why it is so difficult to end the war in Ukraine, despite high hopes for peace earlier this year.\n\n\"The reason is Putin,\" the NATO chief replied.\n\nRutte added that the Russian leader is willing to sacrifice 1.1 million of his own people without achieving significant military victories.\n\n\"This year, he (Putin) has made only very minor progress -- minimal territorial gains, less than 1% of Ukrainian territory compared to the beginning of the year. And according to our estimates, up to 1.1 million people on the Russian side have been killed or wounded. This is horrific. But this is the situation we are dealing with,\" Rutte said.\n\nThe NATO Secretary General also noted that US President Donald Trump, who came to power in January and whose arrival raised high hopes for ending the war, is \"absolutely committed to this issue.\"\n\n\"He is focused on stopping this war. He is the only one who has managed to bring Putin to the negotiating table -- and the only one who can ultimately force him to make peace. I respect him very much for that,\" Rutte said.\n\nRutte also emphasized that some European countries have expressed readiness to send troops to Ukraine to preserve peace, as well as in case Russia violates a potential peace agreement.\n\nIn response to journalists' questions, Rutte noted that the details of such a deployment are not discussed publicly. However, some countries have expressed readiness to send troops to Ukraine.\n\n\"We are currently working on the specifics of how this 'coalition of the willing' should be structured: what the deployment would look like, what would happen on land, at sea, in the air, and so on. All these elements are being worked out now,\" he said, explaining the complexity of the situation.",

He is focused on ending this war. Trump is the only one who has managed to bring Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, and the only one who can ultimately force Putin to agree to a peaceful settlement. I have great respect for him for that,\" the Alliance's secretary general said.\n\nOn US support\n\nIn addition, Rutte dismissed concerns about the possible termination of US assistance to Ukraine, particularly in terms of providing intelligence and other data.\n\n\"I don't expect that at all. We are currently seeing that the exchange of information and the supply of weapons to Ukraine are continuing,\" he said.\n\nHowever, according to him, European NATO member states will have to make significant efforts to continue supporting Ukraine.\n\n* \"First, we need to increase defense spending and ramp up production (of weapons and ammunition, ed.).\n\n* Secondly, we need to ensure that Ukraine remains as strong as possible in this struggle. After all, if Russia gains control over the whole of Ukraine, this will have enormous consequences for NATO -- so we will have to spend much more than we agreed (at the NATO summit, ed.) in The Hague,\" Rutte said.",

This issue has garnered significant media attention, with 39 articles from 17 sources published over a three-day period, exhibiting a predominantly negative sentiment (-0.21 average score). The debate centers on the future of European security and the role of the United States in deterring Russian aggression. \n\nThe data reveals a clear divide in stakeholder positions. Mark Rutte consistently emphasizes the necessity of US support, citing the US nuclear umbrella as a \u201cabsolute guarantee.\u201d Vladimir Putin, conversely, frames NATO expansion as a threat to Russia and questions the benefits of Ukrainian membership. Significant financial commitments are being made to Ukraine from the EU, Norway, and through planned deliveries, while companies like Rheinmetall and Lockheed Martin stand to benefit from increased defense spending. Donald Trump is positioned as a potential negotiator by Rutte.",
