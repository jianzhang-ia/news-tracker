      "body": "BRUSSELS: EU finance ministers agreed Friday to impose a three-euro duty on low-value imports into the bloc from July 2026 to help tackle a flood of small parcels ordered via the likes of Shein and Temu. Last year, 4.6 billion small retail packages entered the European Union -- more than 145 per second -- with 91 percent originating in China and their numbers expected to keep rising.\n\nStarting at three euros, the new fee will apply once per item in cases where packages contain different products, but only once if they contain multiples of the same item, a spokesperson for the European Council told AFP. The move comes a month after the EU agreed to scrap a duty exemption for parcels worth less than 150 euros ($174) imported directly to consumers in the 27-nation bloc, in many cases via Chinese-founded platforms.\n\nThe levy will be introduced on a temporary basis starting July 1, staying in place until the bloc can settle on a permanent solution for taxing such imports. \"This temporary measure responds to the fact that such parcels currently enter the EU duty free, leading to unfair competition for EU sellers, health and safety risks for consumers, high levels of fraud and environmental concerns,\" the Council, which represents EU member states, said in a statement.\n\nEuropean retailers argue they face unfair competition from overseas platforms, such as AliExpress, Shein and Temu, which they claim do not always comply with the EU's stringent rules on products. Key EU power France has made the matter a priority, given the around 800 million such packages shipped to the country last year and strong domestic pressure to take action.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Roland Lescure welcomed the flat tax as \"a major victory for the European Union\". \"Europe is taking concrete steps to protect its single market, its consumers and its sovereignty,\" he said. The move comes as the EU strives to bolster the continent's competitiveness by making the lives of European businesses easier through slashing red tape. Alongside ending the duty exemption, the EU executive in May proposed a small package handling fee worth two euros. -- AFP\n\nEU member states have yet to agree on the level of that fee, but hope it will apply from late 2026. Fed up with waiting, some states have already moved forward with their own plans, including Romania, which has imposed a five-euro fee on small parcels. -- AFP",

      "title": "EU Approves 3 Euro Fee on Small Parcels, Targeting Shein and Temu",
      "body": "PARIS - European Union finance ministers agreed on Friday to impose a 3 euro customs duty on inexpensive packages entering the bloc, a move aimed at curbing the surge of ultra-low cost e-commerce imports from platforms such as Shein and Temu and easing pressure on domestic retailers.\n\nThe fee will take effect from July 1, 2026, and will apply to all parcels valued at under 150 euros shipped into the EU from outside the bloc.\n\nIt comes weeks after the EU agreed to scrap a longstanding customs duty exemption, a loophole similar to the \"de minimus\" rule in the U.S., that has caused a surge in shipments of inexpensive clothing and goods, many of them originating in China.\n\nWhile the charge will apply to parcels from all non-EU countries, officials made it clear that this is a move to curb Chinese-founded platforms such as , Temu and AliExpress, due to their DTC shipping models built around high volumes of low-priced goods.\n\nUnder the new system, each parcel will be subject to a flat charge of 3 euros. If multiple identical items, such as shirts, are shipped together, the fee will apply once, while parcels containing a mix of products, such as five shirts and one charging cable, the fee will be applied for each product category.\n\nThe fee applies per parcel, not per retailer, meaning platforms that rely on splitting orders into multiple shipments could face significantly higher costs.\n\nAccording to European Commission data, 4.6 billion parcels valued under 150 euros entered the EU in 2024, equaling more than 145 every second. The volume has more than tripled since 2022, overwhelming customs authorities and intensifying complaints from European retailers. About 91 percent originated in China.\n\nRetailers across the bloc have argued that overseas e-commerce platforms benefit from unfair advantages, selling low-cost goods that often bypass EU product safety, environmental and consumer protection standards. The influx of parcels has made it difficult for customs officials to intercept counterfeit or dangerous products.\n\nFrance has been at the forefront of pushing for fees, citing the roughly 800 million small parcels shipped into the country last year.\n\n\"The introduction of a flat-rate charge on small parcels is a major victory for the European Union,\" said French economy minister Roland Lescure. \"Europe is taking concrete steps to protect its single market, its consumers and its sovereignty.\"\n\nThe fee is seen as a stopgap as the EU works to set up a more permanent framework to handle billions of incoming shipments across the bloc. Additional processing fees on small parcels are expected to follow from November 2026 to help fund enhanced customs controls.\n\nEU officials said the 3 euro fee is temporary and will remain in place only until a permanent framework for taxing small parcels is agreed as part of a broader reform of the EU's customs union, currently slated for 2028.",

      "body": "EU finance ministers have agreed to introduce a \u20ac3 tax on low-value parcels entering the European Union from July 2026, marking a major step toward curbing the flood of cheap online imports, particularly from China-based platforms such as Shein and Temu.\n\nThe measure will end the long-standing tax-free status for packages worth less than \u20ac150, known as the \"de minimis\" exemption. Under the new system, a flat \u20ac3 duty will apply per type of item contained in a parcel. For example, a package containing multiple units of the same product will be taxed once, but additional product types will each incur an extra \u20ac3 charge.\n\nThe tax is intended as a temporary solution while the EU works on a broader reform of its Customs Union, expected to be completed by 2028. Once that overhaul is in place, authorities aim to tax imports based on their actual value and product category, a system that requires far greater data sharing than currently exists.\n\nThe European Commission proposed the flat tax in response to an unprecedented surge in small parcels entering the bloc. In the first nine months of 2025 alone, the EU received more packages than in all of 2024, when 4.6 billion parcels arrived-more than 145 per second. Around 91 percent of these shipments originated in China.\n\nEU officials say the influx has overwhelmed customs authorities and raised serious safety, environmental, and consumer protection concerns. According to one EU official, up to 80 percent of such parcels at some airports fail to comply with EU safety standards, posing risks from unsafe toys and household goods while generating large volumes of waste.\n\nEuropean retailers have long complained that overseas platforms benefit from unfair competition by avoiding duties and regulatory scrutiny. France, which received around 800 million small parcels last year, has pushed strongly for action and recently suspended access to Shein's online platform. French Finance Minister Roland Lescure hailed the agreement as \"a major victory,\" saying it protects Europe's single market, consumers, and economic sovereignty.\n\nThe \u20ac3 EU-wide duty is separate from a proposed handling fee aimed at covering customs processing costs. The European Commission has suggested a \u20ac2 handling fee, though member states have yet to agree on its level. Some countries, tired of waiting, have already introduced national measures, including Romania, which now charges \u20ac5 on small parcels.\n\nThe temporary levy will take effect on July 1, 2026, remaining in place until a permanent EU-wide system is agreed.",

      "body": "BRUSSELS - EU finance ministers agreed on Nov 12 to impose a \u20ac3 (S$4.54) duty on all small parcels imported into the bloc starting July 1, 2026, to help tackle a flood of cheap imports by the likes of Shein and Temu.\n\nThe move comes a month after the bloc agreed to scrap a duty exemption for packages worth less than \u20ac150 euros imported directly to consumers in the 27-nation bloc, in many cases via Chinese-founded platforms.\n\nThe fixed fee will be introduced on a temporary basis and will stay in place until the bloc can settle on a permanent solution for taxing such imports, an EU spokesperson said.\n\nIn 2024, 4.6 billion such small packages entered the European Union - more than 145 per second - with 91 per cent originating in China.\n\nThe EU expects those numbers to rise.\n\nEuropean retailers argue they face unfair competition from overseas platforms, such as AliExpress, Shein and Temu, which they claim do not often comply with the EU's stringent rules on products.\n\nKey EU power France has made the matter a priority, given the around 800 million such packages shipped to the country in 2024 and strong domestic pressure to take action.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Roland Lescure welcomed the flat tax as \"a major victory for the European Union\".\n\n\"Europe is taking concrete steps to protect its single market, its consumers and its sovereignty,\" he said.\n\nThe move comes as the EU strives to bolster the continent's competitiveness by making the lives of European businesses easier through slashing red tape.\n\nAlongside ending the duty exemption, the EU executive in May proposed a small package handling fee worth \u20ac2.\n\nEU member states have yet to agree on the level of that fee, but hope it will apply from late 2026.

Imports this year are set to be even higher.\n\nThe EU is also considering a separate handling fee, which the European Commission has proposed should be set at \u20ac2 per parcel.
