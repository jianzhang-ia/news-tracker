Hours later, President Donald Trump said the United States would run Venezuela \"at least temporarily\" and tap its vast oil reserves for sale to other nations.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the capture, Trump outlined plans to \"fix\" Venezuela's oil infrastructure and sell \"large amounts\" of oil abroad.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized from their home on a military base and taken aboard a US warship before being flown to New York. A plane carrying Maduro landed Saturday evening, where federal agents escorted a detainee off the aircraft.\n\nMaduro was then flown by helicopter to New York City and transferred to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Footage showed him at a Manhattan helipad en route to the DEA's New York Division headquarters for processing.",

      "body": "Here's a breakdown of the key events and statements from the provided text,focusing\u2062 on the US actions against Maduro and the Venezuelan government's response:\n\nKey Events:\n\n* Maduro's \"Capture\" (or Raid): Maduro and his wife,Cilia Flores,were taken into custody in New York. The Venezuelan\u2064 government is calling this an \"illegal and \u2063illegitimate kidnapping.\" A video shows Maduro being escorted by DEA agents.\n\n* Charges: Maduro and Flores face federal charges related to drug trafficking and collaboration with terrorist organizations. Maduro denies these charges.\n\n* US Operation:  The US conducted a raid to apprehend Maduro, resulting in reported casualties\u2062 among his bodyguards (the exact number is unconfirmed).\n\n* Trump's Threat: Trump issued\u2062 a warning to Delcy \u2064Rodriguez, stating \u2062she would \"pay a very big price\" if she doesn't \"do what's right.\"\n\nKey Statements & Positions:\n\n* Delcy\u2063 Rodriguez (venezuelan Foreign Minister): Condemned the US actions as \"barbaric\" and \u2062a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty. She demanded the immediate \u2063release of Maduro and his wife. \u2062 She also expressed willingness to have \"respectful \u2063relations\" with the Trump governance, \u2064despite the attack.\n\n* Donald Trump (US \u2064President): Appeared to threaten rodriguez. He also stated that some US forces were involved and that there were some casualties.\n\n* Marco\u2064 Rubio (US \u2062Secretary of State): Described conversations with Rodriguez and the Venezuelan government as \"delicate and complicated.\" He emphasized the US goal remains the same, but \u2063now they have someone they can potentially work with, unlike Maduro.\n\n* Padrino Lopez (Venezuelan Defense Minister): Claimed some of Maduro's bodyguards were killed \"in cold blood\" during the raid, but did\u2062 not provide specific numbers.\n\nOverall \u2062Situation:\n\nThe situation is highly tense. The US has taken direct action against Maduro, arresting\u2062 him and his wife on serious charges. Venezuela views this as a hostile act and is demanding their release. There's\u2064 a mix of condemnation and a stated willingness to engage in dialog from the Venezuelan side, while the US appears to be signaling a shift in approach\u2062 now that Maduro is in custody. The potential for further \u2064escalation remains high,especially given Trump's threat.",

      "body": "The United States carried out an operation against Venezuela, which it has long signaled openly, last night. Delta Force troops entered the capital Caracas and captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.\n\nAs Maduro and his wife were taken aboard a U.S. warship, they were transported to New York. Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were brought to the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York.\n\nWhile Maduro is expected to appear before a judge for the first time tomorrow, a scandal was created. Maduro was displayed behind a vehicle on the streets of New York.\n\nOn the other hand, the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC Brooklyn) in New York is a detention facility operated by the federal government and has been in the news for its poor living conditions, especially in recent years. This center, where defendants with ongoing trials are held, is associated with humanitarian crises such as chronic staff shortages, hygiene issues, incidents of violence, and freezing cold.\n\nThe institution, which hosts many high-profile inmates including globally renowned figures like Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and Sam Bankman-Fried, is considered one of the most concrete symbols of the flaws in the American penal system today.\n\nOn the other hand, it was stated that before being taken to New York, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife would be brought to the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba and transferred to New York from there. According to a report by CNN based on two sources close to the matter, the ship carrying the Maduro couple will go to Guantanamo.\n\nFrom there, the couple will be transferred to a plane to be taken to New York. Guantanamo is known for hosting a military prison where detainees were held for years after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and frequently came into the spotlight due to allegations of torture.\n\nAdditionally, in a document published on the Justice Department's website, Maduro is accused of \"running a corrupt, illegitimate government for years.\" The document also states that Maduro misused the power of the government for illegal activities, primarily drug trafficking.\n\nThe document claims that Maduro's drug trafficking activities enriched Venezuela's military and political elite. It also states, \"Maduro has collaborated with the most dangerous drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world.\"",

      "body": "Close up video footage shows captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro being escorted off a plane at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York on Saturday afternoon, surrounded by multiple federal agents wearing Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) jackets.\n\nThe plane carrying Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores landed at the military facility in Newburgh, approximately 60 miles north of Manhattan, just before 5:00 PM Eastern Time on January 3, 2026. Aerial footage captured by news helicopters and ground cameras showed law enforcement personnel boarding the Department of Justice aircraft before Maduro emerged nearly an hour later.\n\nVideo from multiple news outlets including CNN, Fox News and NBC showed Maduro, wearing what appeared to be a light blue or gray hooded sweatsuit, being led down the aircraft stairs flanked by numerous federal agents. The captured leader was then escorted across the tarmac to a nearby helipad for onward transport to Manhattan.\n\nAdditional video posted by the White House Rapid Response account on X later Saturday evening appeared to show Maduro walking down a hallway inside DEA headquarters in Manhattan, escorted by three agents wearing DEA jackets. The brief clip showed distinctive DEA NYD carpeting, indicating the location as the agency's New York Division offices.\n\nMaduro arrived at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn, at approximately 8:52 PM Eastern Time on Saturday. The facility is one of few detention centers in the United States with capacity for high security defendants. His wife's confinement status remained unknown as of Saturday night.\n\nThe arrival came hours after United States forces executed Operation Absolute Resolve, a predawn raid that extracted Maduro and Flores from their residence at the heavily fortified Fuerte Tiuna military compound in Caracas. Delta Force operators accompanied by FBI agents entered the couple's bedroom around 2:01 AM local time Saturday while they were sleeping.\n\nFollowing the bedroom capture, Maduro and Flores were transported by helicopter to the USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship positioned offshore. President Donald Trump shared a photo on Truth Social showing Maduro aboard the warship wearing a gray tracksuit, handcuffed and blindfolded, before being flown to New York.\n\nThe extraordinary military operation involved over 150 aircraft launching from 20 different bases across the Western Hemisphere. Forces approached Caracas flying just 100 feet above water to avoid radar detection while a massive air component including F-22 Raptors, F-35 Lightning II fighters and B-1B Lancer bombers dismantled Venezuela's air defense systems.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced that Maduro and Flores face charges in a superseding indictment filed in the Southern District of New York. The indictment accuses them of conspiracy to commit narco terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.\n\nThe charges appear similar to those filed in a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides. According to the new indictment prepared by New York United States Attorney Jay Clayton, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust for over 25 years to import tons of cocaine into the United States, with Maduro at the forefront of that corruption.\n\nThe indictment alleges Flores brokered a meeting between a large scale drug trafficker and the director of Venezuela's National Anti Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres, and allegedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007. Prosecutors allege the trafficker arranged bribes of 100,000 dollars per flight to ship cocaine.\n\nMaduro is expected to appear in federal court for arraignment as early as Monday, January 5, before United States District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein in Manhattan. The case is assigned to the Southern District of New York, where federal prosecutors have jurisdiction over international drug trafficking cases affecting the United States.\n\nTrump announced at a press conference Saturday that the United States will run Venezuela at least temporarily and tap the country's vast oil reserves to sell to other nations. \"We're going to run it, essentially,\" Trump stated. \"It's going to be run very judiciously, very fairly\" until a safe, proper and judicious transition can be accomplished.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, whose whereabouts remain unknown, appeared on state run television Saturday demanding immediate proof of life for Maduro and Flores. She stated that Maduro remains Venezuela's only president and that the government does not know their whereabouts.\n\nTrump said Rodriguez was sworn in as president on Saturday afternoon, though her location and the legitimacy of any such ceremony remain disputed. Rodriguez has stated Venezuela is ready to defend its natural resources against what she characterized as American aggression.\n\nInternational reactions varied sharply to Maduro's capture and arrival in New York. Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, declared \"the HOUR OF FREEDOM has arrived\" and called for Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, widely regarded as the legitimate winner of Venezuela's 2024 elections, to assume the presidency. Gonz\u00e1lez currently lives in exile in Spain.\n\nDemocratic Senator Mark Warner, Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, expressed concerns about the precedent set by the operation. \"Does this mean any large country can indict the ruler of a smaller adjacent country and take that person out?\" Warner told CBS News. \"This would lead to total chaos, this theory of the case.\"\n\nRepublican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania pushed back against Trump's statement about running Venezuela. \"The only country that the United States of America should be running is the United States of America,\" Fitzpatrick stated.\n\nProtesters gathered outside Stewart Air National Guard Base Saturday afternoon as news spread of Maduro's expected arrival. Demonstrators included members of the Democratic Socialists of America who criticized the military action, arguing the United States should focus on domestic problems rather than foreign interventions.\n\nThe video footage of Maduro's arrival marks a historic moment in United States relations with Latin America. No sitting head of state has been captured and transported to American soil to face criminal charges in modern history, raising complex questions about international law, sovereignty and the limits of American military power.\n\nThe operation represents the most dramatic action of Trump's second term as president and fulfills his administration's long standing threats against Maduro's government. Trump had deployed a United States Navy task force to the Caribbean in December, with the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford conducting operations as part of a military buildup that preceded the final strike.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that Maduro led a narco terrorism conspiracy responsible for flooding American communities with cocaine. The Trump administration designated what it called Cartel de los Soles, described as a Venezuelan government corruption network rather than a traditional cartel, as a foreign terrorist organization in November.\n\nMaduro has repeatedly denied accusations against him and previously accused the United States of attempting to remove him from power to gain access to Venezuela's oil reserves. In a state television interview that aired Thursday, he called the charges as false as accusations of weapons of mass destruction that led the United States into eternal war.",

      "body": "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken from their home in Venezuela's capital city Caracas in a dramatic nighttime US military operation.\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Centre, or MDC Brooklyn, in New York City, after landing at a small airport there on Saturday evening local time.\n\nFootage released by authorities shows the now effectively former Venezuelan leader exiting an aircraft in handcuffs, surrounded by US agents.\n\nIn the published videos and pictures of him, Maduro is wearing sportswear, including a sports jacket and a hat accompanied with sweatpants, white socks and flip-flops.\n\nThat might indicate the speed of the operation and how it may have taken Maduro by surprise, with US network CNN reporting that he and his wife were asleep before being dragged from their bedroom when US military forces entered their residence.\n\nFootage released by US authorities shows the former dictator being frog-marched down a hallway by federal agents. They walk over a carpet stamped with \"DEA NYD\", \"Rule of Law\" and \"Respect\". Apparently upon noticing he is being filmed, Maduro is heard saying \"Good night and Happy New Year\".\n\nIn a separate video, Maduro appeared injured as US officials pulled him out of a vehicle. The footage raised speculation that he may have been wounded during his capture in Caracas.\n\nThe US military operation to capture Maduro took place early on Saturday, with at least seven blasts heard around the capital Caracas in an attack that lasted less than 30 minutes.\n\nDespite it apparently being a surprise, Trump stated afterwards that Maduro's safe house was a military \"fortress\" in the heart of Caracas. \"They were in a ready position waiting for us. They knew we were coming,\" he added.\n\nDescribing the attack further, he remarked \"they just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broken into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason\".\n\nUS Air Force General Caine, who is also a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provided more information on its tactical background - \"The apprehension force descended into Maduro's compound and moved with speed, precision and discipline,\" he said, adding that the \"meticulously planned\" mission involved more than 150 aircraft.",

      "title": "Caracas to Cuffs: Ousted Venezuelan Tyrant Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Airlifted to NYC Following U.S. Seizure",
      "body": "Caracas to Cuffs: Ousted Venezuelan Tyrant Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Airlifted to NYC Following U.S. Seizure\n\nBy: Fern Sidman\n\nBy any measure, Saturday night marked one of the most extraordinary moments in the modern history of U.S.-Latin American relations. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro -- the iron-fisted ruler who for more than a decade turned Venezuela into a narco-state, a humanitarian catastrophe and a geopolitical tinderbox -- arrived in New York not as a head of state, but as a federal detainee.\n\nAs reported on Saturday evening in The New York Post, the ousted Venezuelan strongman and his wife, former first lady Cilia Flores, touched down at Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh just after 5 p.m., ferried into American custody by U.S. forces following a lightning military operation in Caracas earlier that morning. Their arrival in New York City was not cloaked in diplomatic ceremony, but in the unmistakable choreography of criminal justice: a military helicopter, a heavily armed motorcade, and finally the hulking armored Bearcat vehicle more commonly associated with terrorist takedowns than with foreign leaders.\n\nBy 7 p.m., according to The New York Post report, Maduro and Flores were whisked from a Manhattan heliport to the Drug Enforcement Administration's headquarters in Chelsea, where federal agents processed them like any other high-value suspects in a narcotics conspiracy. From there, the pair were returned to the West 30th Street Heliport and flown under tight escort down the West Side of Manhattan, passing the Statue of Liberty -- a jarring tableau that symbolized the grotesque inversion of Maduro's once-formidable power.\n\nIn Brooklyn, they were transferred into another fortified convoy bound for the Metropolitan Detention Center, the same facility that has housed some of the world's most infamous criminals. As the Bearcat rumbled through city streets, protesters who had gathered in anticipation jeered with unrestrained fury.\n\nFor years, The New York Post has chronicled the steady collapse of Venezuela under Maduro's regime -- from hyperinflation that wiped out the savings of an entire generation to mass emigration that hollowed out whole cities. Yet the final act in this tragic saga unfolded with cinematic abruptness.\n\nAt dawn Saturday, U.S. special forces executed a precision operation in Caracas, seizing Maduro and Flores from their heavily guarded compound. The move, sanctioned by the White House, was justified as the enforcement of long-standing criminal indictments in the Southern District of New York, where Maduro has been charged since 2020 with leading what prosecutors describe as a \"narco-terrorism enterprise.\"\n\nAccording to the charges, Maduro and his inner circle transformed the Venezuelan state into a logistical arm of the so-called Cartel of the Suns -- a criminal network that collaborated with Colombia's FARC guerrillas to flood the United States with cocaine. The alleged crimes include conspiracy to import thousands of tons of narcotics, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and the coordination of weapons shipments to foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nMaduro's wife, Cilia Flores -- once known in Caracas as the \"First Combatant\" for her aggressive political role -- now stands accused as a full partner in the scheme. Their son, Nicol\u00e1s Ernesto Maduro Guerra, nicknamed \"The Prince,\" has also been charged with facilitating cocaine trafficking, turning the Maduro dynasty into what federal prosecutors portray as a family-run criminal syndicate.\n\nPresident Trump wasted no time framing the arrest as a moral watershed.\n\n\"They will face the full wrath of American justice,\" Trump said at a press conference, adding that the United States would temporarily \"run the country\" until a transition government could be installed in Caracas. As The New York Post report noted, this language was not diplomatic euphemism but an unmistakable declaration of intent: the Maduro era is over.\n\nThe administration's position is that Venezuela's oil reserves -- the largest proven reserves on Earth -- were systematically looted under Maduro's stewardship. U.S. officials allege that billions in American-linked assets were siphoned off through opaque state oil deals, shell companies, and illicit partnerships with China, Russia, and Iran, effectively nationalizing wealth that Washington says was stolen from U.S. investors and bondholders.\n\nFor years, Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA was accused of operating less as a national enterprise and more as a laundering mechanism for the regime. As The New York Post has reported in multiple investigations, entire cargoes of crude were allegedly diverted, misreported, or traded under the table to finance Maduro's political survival.\n\nThe irony of Maduro's final destination was not lost on the crowd gathered outside the Metropolitan Detention Center.\n\nHere was a man who once addressed the nation from gilded balconies, who ruled through secret police and military patronage, now reduced to a detainee number in a Brooklyn jail.\n\nSources cited by The New York Post said Maduro could appear in federal court as early as Monday, facing arraignment on charges that carry potential life sentences. His wife is expected to be processed alongside him, a symbolic dismantling of the myth that Venezuela's first family was untouchable.\n\nLegal experts told the paper that prosecutors are likely to seek pretrial detention, arguing that Maduro's history of flight, his foreign alliances, and the severity of the charges make him an extraordinary flight risk.\n\nBack in Caracas, the aftermath is chaos. With Maduro gone, Venezuela has plunged into what diplomats are calling a constitutional crisis. Loyalists in the military are reportedly split, some calling for calm, others warning of foreign occupation. Streets that once hosted government-orchestrated rallies are now filled with spontaneous demonstrations -- some jubilant, others fearful of what comes next.\n\nThe New York Post report noted that this is the first time since the capture of Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega in 1989 that the United States has seized a sitting Latin American leader and brought him to New York in chains. Then, as now, Washington justified the move as law enforcement rather than regime change, a distinction that may matter legally but carries explosive political consequences.\n\nYet the symbolism is unmistakable. The world has just watched the most entrenched autocrat in the Western Hemisphere become a defendant in a U.S. courtroom.\n\nThe reaction in New York has been visceral. Outside the MDC in Brooklyn, Venezuelan expatriates waved flags and wept openly, some celebrating what they called \"the end of the nightmare,\" others demanding that the U.S. not merely prosecute Maduro but help rebuild their shattered homeland.\n\nAcross the city, political fault lines emerged instantly. While President Trump framed the arrest as overdue justice, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani publicly condemned it as an \"act of war,\" accusing the administration of violating international law. Governor Kathy Hochul echoed those concerns, calling the operation \"reckless.\"\n\nBut the crowd in Brooklyn was unmoved.\n\n\"Where was international law when our children starved?\" one protester told The New York Post. \"Where was Mamdani when Maduro stole our country?\"\n\nFor decades, Maduro cultivated an image of permanence -- a leader molded in the shadow of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, convinced of his own historical destiny. But history is rarely as forgiving as tyrants believe.\n\nNow he is a federal inmate, processed at DEA headquarters in Chelsea, flown past Lady Liberty under guard, and deposited in a detention center where the clang of steel doors is the only ceremony afforded to disgraced despots.\n\nThe New York Post captured the moment succinctly: the fall of Maduro was not a coup. It was a perp walk.\n\nAnd in the annals of American law enforcement, it may stand as the moment the narco-state finally met its prosecutor.",

Trump also confirmed \"large-scale strikes\" in Venezuela in a statement on Truth Social.\n\nTrump, 79, has accused the Venezuelan president of drug trafficking and \"forcing\" migration to the U.S., as well as using oil money to fund his alleged drug-related crimes.\n\nTrump ordered airstrikes on various Venezuelan sites, including the main military base, Fuerte Tiuna, the main airbase, La Carlota, El Volc\u00e1n, a signal antenna site, and La Guaira Port, a seaport on the coast of the Caribbean, CBS News and the BBC reported, citing officials.\n\nThe Venezuelan government denounced the attacks in a statement, accusing the U.S. of trying to \"seize Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals\" and \"forcibly break the nation's political independence,\" per the BBC. All national defense plans are to be implemented in the country after the strikes, the outlet reported.\n\nFollowing Maduro's capture, Trump shared an unverified image of the Venezuelan President on Truth Social wearing large blacked-out glasses and headphones to limit his vision and hearing as he was transported to New York.\n\n\"Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima,\" Trump captioned the image.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nDuring a press conference on Saturday, the U.S. president said that during the attacks on Venezuela, Maduro reached a safe room but was \"unable to close\" the door as U.S. special forces broke through and seized him.\n\nHe added that even if the door had been shut in time, Maduro wouldn't have been safe \"because we would have had the door blown up in about 47 seconds.\"\n\nFollowing Maduro's capture, Trump said the U.S. will now \"run\" Venezuela.\n\n\"No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved, successfully capturing Maduro in the dead of night,\" he continued. \"We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be...we're gonna run it properly. We're gonna make sure the people of Venezuela are taken care of.\"",

The facility is infamous for its harsh conditions and history of understaffing, and has previously held defendants accused of major crimes, from organised crime figures to high\u2011profile financial and sex crimes, Axios reported.\n\nMaduro faces a battery of charges in the US, including narco\u2011terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and weapons\u2011related offenses. His wife, Cilia Flores, and son are also listed as defendants in the indictment, according to US authorities.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shared images of Maduro aboard a U.S. military ship after his capture, saying that Maduro and his wife would \"face American justice.\" Trump's remarks suggested that the operation aimed not only to detain Maduro but to hold him accountable under US law.\n\nMaduro to be placed in special housing unit?\n\nSources told Fox News that Maduro will likely be placed initially in a special housing unit for high\u2011profile inmates before being moved to another secure section of the facility.\n\nThe dramatic turn of events in Venezuela has generated international reactions, with some governments condemning the US action as a breach of sovereignty. Domestic political debate is also intensifying over the legality and implications of the U.S. strike and Maduro's detention.",

      "body": "Nicolas Maduro walking in the DEA building in New York in a screenshot from a video posted on the official White House account on X\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro is being held in a Brooklyn jail following a nighttime US military raid that seized him and his wife from their bedroom during a large-scale operation carried out in Caracas. After arriving in New York, the now-ousted Venezuelan president is being detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he will remain in federal custody pending his initial court appearance. He is expected to face charges related to drug trafficking, weapons offenses and narco-terrorism. No official date has yet been set for the hearing. The facility, known for having held high-profile detainees such as Ghislaine Maxwell and Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, has been criticized by judges and lawmakers for detention conditions described as \"inhumane\".\n\nNew York governor Kathy Hochul said there are currently no credible threats to the state, but confirmed that state police and other law-enforcement agencies are monitoring the situation, particularly given the presence of a large Venezuelan community in the New York metropolitan area. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration has warned travelers of possible delays at New York City-area airports due to temporary restrictions on some flights.\n\nThe indictment against Maduro does not represent a new line of inquiry, but rather the latest development in a case that has been open for more than fifteen years. The first investigations date back to 2011; in 2020 the Department of Justice had already formally brought narco-terrorism charges against Maduro and other Venezuelan officials. The new indictment, which also includes his wife Cilia Flores, has been filed in the case overseen by federal judge Alvin Hellerstein, who has supervised the proceedings for more than a decade. One of the co-defendants, former general Cliver Alcal\u00e1 Cordones, reached a plea deal in 2024 and was sentenced to more than twenty years in prison.",

U.S. military troops swooping in by helicopter. A foreign leader, accused of drug trafficking, hauled off to America in handcuffs.\n\nThe Trump administration's Jan. 3 capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro bore some familiar echoes to the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama that ousted military strongman Manuel Noriega -- and marked the most direct U.S. intervention in Latin America since.\n\nBut experts say that despite some similarities, the two key moments in America's long and checkered history of interventions differ in major ways that could make achieving U.S. goals more challenging this time following a raid that has revived regional anxiety.\n\nTrump: 'We are going to run' Venezuela until transition\n\nHours after his administration struck Venezuela and deposed its president, Trump said at a Saturday news conference that the U.S. plans to run the country until a transition in leadership can take place.\n\n\"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said, \"It has to be judicious, because that's what we are all about.\"\n\nThe president did not immediately provide additional details on how the U.S. planned to manage the sovereign nation.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" earlier in the day, Trump declined to say whether he would back Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, the winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, for the presidency.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nMaduro's journey to NY: Ships, planes and helicopters\n\nMaduro and Flores landed in Brooklyn before heading to the Metropolitan Detention Center the evening of Jan. 3.\n\nBy then, they had been on multiple types of aircraft, plus a massive warship, in a journey spanning at least three nations and two time zones.\n\nAfter the couple was taken from their Caracas home, they were loaded onto a helicopter, where the raid force had to fight its way out of Venezuelan airspace, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Dan \"Razin\" Caine.\n\nThey were then loaded onto the USS Iwo Jima, a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship, and sailed across the Caribbean Sea to the U.S military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nNext, they were transferred to a plane to fly the final stretch to New York, landing shortly before sunset Eastern time at Stewart Air National Guard Base about 50 miles north of Manhattan. Once embarked, they were placed in helicopters and flown to Westside Heliport in Manhattan, then finally on to the Brooklyn detention facility.\n\nA 'soul full of concern'\n\nPope Leo said on Sunday he was following developments in Venezuela after the United States' toppling of Maduro a day earlier with a \"soul full of concern.\"\n\nLeo, the first U.S. pope, called for Venezuela to remain an independent country and respect of human rights.\n\n- Reuters\n\nMaduro walked down hallway in new footage\n\nIn the first clear video of the Venezuelan leader since he arrived on U.S. soil Saturday evening, Maduro was seen being walked down a hallway by federal agents.\n\nThe 12-second clip was posted to X by Fox News Contributor Paul Mauro and shared by the White House. In the video, Maduro is seen clutching a bottle of water and dressed in black pants, a black hoodie and hat.\n\nHis hands appear to be restrained, while three agents walk him down a hallway with a carpet that reads \"DEA.\" He is overheard saying, \"goodnight\" and \"happy New Year\" before walking out of the video frame.\n\nVenezuela Supreme Court orders VP become interim president\n\nThe Constitutional Chamber of Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered on Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez assume the role of acting president of the country.\n\nThe court ruling said that Rodr\u00edguez would assume \"the office of President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in order to guarantee administrative continuity and the comprehensive defense of the Nation.\"\n\nThe ruling added that the court will debate the matter in order to \"determine the applicable legal framework to guarantee the continuity of the State, the administration of government, and the defense of sovereignty in the face of the forced absence of the President of the Republic.\"",

      "body": "Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, awoke early Saturday morning to U.S. special forces capturing them from their capital city compound, and by the end of the day they were in federal custody in New York.\n\nOver the span of a few hours on Saturday, U.S. strikes targeted air defenses and other sites in Caracas and three other Venezuelan states, whisking away both Maduro and Flores and transporting them thousands of miles over sea and air to the United States.\n\nThe operation marked a dramatic escalation of President Donald Trump's stance toward Venezuela after months of rising tensions, threats and oil tanker seizures.\n\nMaduro and his wife have been indicted on federal drug and weapons charges, and are expected to attend an arraignment in New York City as early as Monday, according to multiple media reports.\n\nAs global reverberations continue to be felt, many questions remain unanswered, including those regarding the future of U.S.-Venezuela relations and how the South American nation will move forward.\n\nMaduro's journey to NY: Ships, planes and helicopters\n\nMaduro and Flores landed in Brooklyn before heading to the Metropolitan Detention Center the evening of Jan. 3.\n\nBy then, they had been on multiple types of aircraft, plus a massive warship, in a journey spanning at least three nations and two time zones.\n\nAfter the couple was taken from their Caracas home, they were loaded onto a helicopter, where the raid force had to fight its way out of Venezuelan airspace, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Dan \"Razin\" Caine.\n\nThey were then loaded onto the USS Iwo Jima, a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship, and sailed across the Caribbean Sea to the U.S military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nNext, they were transferred to a plane to fly the final stretch to New York, landing shortly before sunset Eastern time at Stewart Air National Guard Base about 50 miles north of Manhattan. Once embarked, they were placed in helicopters and flown to Westside Heliport in Manhattan, then finally on to the Brooklyn detention facility.\n\nA 'soul full of concern'\n\nPope Leo said on Sunday he was following developments in Venezuela after the United States' toppling of Maduro a day earlier with a \"soul full of concern.\"\n\nLeo, the first U.S. pope, called for Venezuela to remain an independent country and respect of human rights.\n\n- Reuters\n\nMaduro walked down hallway in new footage\n\nIn the first clear video of the Venezuelan leader since he arrived on U.S. soil Saturday evening, Maduro was seen being walked down a hallway by federal agents.\n\nThe 12-second clip was posted to X by Fox News Contributor Paul Mauro and shared by the White House. In the video, Maduro is seen clutching a bottle of water and dressed in black pants, a black hoodie and hat.\n\nHis hands appear to be restrained, while three agents walk him down a hallway with a carpet that reads \"DEA.\" He is overheard saying, \"goodnight\" and \"happy New Year\" before walking out of the video frame.\n\nVenezuela Supreme Court orders VP become interim president\n\nThe Constitutional Chamber of Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered on Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez assume the role of acting president of the country.\n\nThe court ruling said that Rodr\u00edguez would assume \"the office of President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in order to guarantee administrative continuity and the comprehensive defense of the Nation.\"\n\nThe ruling added that the court will debate the matter in order to \"determine the applicable legal framework to guarantee the continuity of the State, the administration of government, and the defense of sovereignty in the face of the forced absence of the President of the Republic.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Why did we strike Venezuela, seize Nicol\u00e1s Maduro?

      "title": "\"Happy New Year,\" Maduro Says as He's Marched in Cuffs Through NYC",
      "body": "Nicolas Maduro's reign ended not with a speech or a showdown, but with a whisper in handcuffs. Nearly a full day after U.S. forces captured him in Venezuela, the former strongman finally spoke Saturday night as he was flown into New York City like a defeated king. Helicopters roared overhead, law enforcement swarmed the ground, and a convoy of black SUVs and police vehicles waited below as Maduro was quietly delivered into American custody.\n\nThe dramatic arrival unfolded just after nightfall. As helicopters touched down, sources confirmed the man inside was Maduro himself. Russian officials reportedly reacted with alarm, warning that his capture could send Venezuela spiraling toward financial collapse. From the landing zone, Maduro was transferred again, whisked by helicopter to Manhattan before being loaded into a law enforcement convoy bound for Brooklyn. According to Daily Express US, he arrived at the detention facility just before 9 p.m.\n\nThen came the moment no one expected. As DEA agents escorted him through headquarters, his wrists cuffed, cameras rolling, Maduro looked up and spoke. \"Good night. Happy New Year.\" Just three words. Calm. Almost chilling. Not to mention that, prosecutors are all getting ready to face catastrophic, explosive federal cases in recent times. Reports also say that Maduro might appear in court next week, where he will allegedly face a slate of charges which are tied to drug trafficking, along with illegal weapons.\n\nLegal experts say New York was the inevitable landing spot. \"Now, there's two ways prosecutors can get venue: The first one is if they can show that some part of the conspiracy happened within that district.\" \"But the second way - and I think this is what we're seeing right here - is if the person is being brought in from a foreign country, the first place they touch down and touch American soil, there is automatic venue there.\"\n\nCNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller revealed that the process began even before Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, stepped off their aircraft at Stewart Air National Guard Base. Fingerprints. Photos. Biometrics. Medical checks. \"They will be arrested again before their arraignment, which will likely be on Monday.\" An official said Flores remained behind in a hangar late Saturday undergoing further medical examinations.\n\nOnce inside Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, Miller explained, the couple would be classified as Special Administrative Measures inmates. That means extreme isolation, maximum security, and possibly being kept apart. The NYPD confirmed Maduro reached the jail just before 9 p.m. The facility has housed some of the most notorious names in recent memory, including Sam Bankman-Fried and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.\n\nAs Maduro was processed behind bars, anger spilled onto American streets. Protests erupted nationwide after President Donald Trump's military intervention and the detention of Maduro and Flores. Demonstrators marched through Washington, DC, New York, Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles, waving Venezuelan flags and chanting despite freezing temperatures and pounding rain. From presidential palace to prison walls, Maduro's fall played out in one unforgettable night. And it started with three quiet words.",

      "body": "US forces extracted the Venezuelan president and his wife Cilia Flores from their residence in Caracas in the early hours of Saturday. He was flown to the USS Iwo Jima and later transferred to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. Maduro faces charges in the Southern District of New York, including conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and weapons violations.\n\nThe mission, named Operation Absolute Resolve, involved 150 aircraft launched from 20 sites across the hemisphere. The US military struck at least five locations in and around Caracas, including Fuerte Tiuna and La Carlota air base. Explosions were reported across the capital before dawn. The New York Times reported that at least 40 people were killed in the strikes.\n\nMaduro attempted to hide in a steel-fortified safe room but was apprehended by a Delta Force unit after failing to secure the door. The US said no personnel were killed, and injuries were minimal. Trump later shared an image of Maduro blindfolded aboard a US vessel.\n\nVenezuela declared a national emergency and mobilised armed forces. Vice-President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was named interim leader by the country's Supreme Court, which cited the need to ensure \"administrative continuity.\" Rodr\u00edguez called for Maduro's immediate release, labelling the operation a kidnapping.\n\nTrump said the US would assume responsibility for the country's governance, including restoring Venezuela's oil infrastructure and \"starting to make money for the country and for us.\" He stated that any future transition would be \"safe, proper and judicious.\"\n\nThe US president said that Rodr\u00edguez had expressed willingness to cooperate during a call with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, though this contradicts her public statements.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed Maduro and Flores had been indicted on multiple charges, including the importation of cocaine and possession of destructive devices. Bondi said the pair would \"soon face the full wrath of American justice.\"\n\nVideo footage released by federal authorities showed Maduro arriving at the Drug Enforcement Administration office in Manhattan before being transferred to the Brooklyn detention facility. The whereabouts of Flores remain unconfirmed.\n\nThis screengrab taken from the X account of Rapid Response 47, the official White House rapid response account, shows Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (C) escorted by DEA agents inside the headquarters of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in lower Manhattan, New York, on January 3, 2026. Photo: X account of Rapid Response 47 / AFP\n\nThe Metropolitan Detention Center, where Maduro is now held, is known for housing high-profile prisoners and has faced numerous allegations of mistreatment. Maduro's arraignment is expected on Monday.\n\nRussia, China, Iran and Brazil have condemned the attack, calling it a breach of international law. China's Foreign Ministry said the United States must \"immediately release\" Maduro and his wife. Russia described the strike as \"armed aggression\" and called for urgent dialogue.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Maduro's removal, urging a peaceful transition led by opposition figure Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, who his government considers to have won Venezuela's disputed 2024 election. Venezuela's Foreign Ministry rejected Macron's comments as \"unacceptable interference.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK \"shed no tears\" over the fall of Maduro's government but declined to confirm whether the military action had legal justification. He later said the UK would seek a peaceful transition in coordination with the US.\n\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \"deeply alarmed,\" warning of a dangerous precedent. The Security Council will meet on Monday to address the situation.\n\nInside the US, political fallout continues. Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Bernie Sanders, have condemned the operation, accusing Trump of violating international law. Sanders compared the action to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"rank imperialism.\"\n\nWithin Trump's own Republican Party, some lawmakers have expressed concern. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene said the strike betrayed the non-interventionist principles of the \"America First\" movement. Senator Thomas Massie said Trump had overstepped his authority by launching an unauthorised military operation.\n\nOutside the White House and in cities such as Los Angeles and New York, anti-war demonstrations criticised the US action. Protesters accused Trump of seizing Venezuela's oil and warned against further escalation.\n\nVenezuela holds the world's largest proven oil reserves. Its oil production has declined sharply due to sanctions, mismanagement and lack of investment. In 2023, Venezuela accounted for just 0.8 percent of global crude output. Trump has stated that US oil companies will be sent in to restore infrastructure and increase exports.\n\nThe seizure of Maduro marks the first US military incursion in Latin America of this scale since the 1989 invasion of Panama. Analysts have drawn comparisons to the US capture of Manuel Noriega, though the long-term consequences of Trump's move remain uncertain.\n\nOpposition figure Mar\u00eda Corina Machado has called for Gonz\u00e1lez to be recognised as interim president. Trump said she lacks sufficient domestic support. Panama and Argentina have already voiced support for Gonz\u00e1lez, citing his claimed victory in the 2024 election.\n\nAmnesty International and other rights groups have criticised the operation. Amnesty's Agnes Callamard said the move \"deepens the breakdown of international law and the rules-based order.\" The UN special rapporteur on counterterrorism called for Trump to be impeached and investigated for the attack.\n\nTrump has insisted that the intervention will benefit both Americans and Venezuelans. He said the operation has demonstrated \"American dominance\" and aligns with his \"Donroe Doctrine\" - a rebranding of the Monroe Doctrine - asserting US control over the Western Hemisphere.\n\nHT",

If he says he is serious about something, he means it. Don't play games, don't play games with this President in office because it's not gonna turn out well.\"\n\nTrump also features in the video, lauding the US forces: \"This is one of the most stunning, effective and powerful display of American military's might and competence in American history.\"\n\nIn between, the video cuts to footage of the operation carried out in Caracas on Saturday, with American fighter jets taking off and explosions in the Venezuelan capital.\n\nMaduro and his wife were first taken to the DEA headquarters and later believed to be transported in a helicopter to the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn.

      "body": "New York, January 3: Deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro arrived in federal custody in New York late Saturday, following a high-stakes U.S. military operation in Caracas. In his first brief comments captured on video since the extraction, a handcuffed Maduro was heard wishing \"Goodnight\" and a \"Happy New Year\" to federal agents as he was escorted into the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) offices. The capture, dubbed \"Operation Absolute Resolve,\" has sparked a global firestorm of legal and diplomatic debate, even as Maduro remains detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn pending his first court appearance.\n\nFootage released by the White House on Sunday showed the 63-year-old former president, dressed in a black hooded sweatshirt and a hat, walking through a hallway marked with the DEA New York Division seal. Surrounded by federal agents, Maduro appeared calm but weary as he made the transition from the heart of the Venezuelan presidency to a federal jail cell. U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi confirmed that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who was also captured in the raid, will face the \"full wrath of American justice.\" The two are expected to be arraigned in Manhattan federal court as early as Monday on charges including narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, and weapons offenses. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro Locked Up in Notorious Federal Jail in New York After Capture by US.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, the operation was the result of months of rehearsal involving elite special operations units, including Delta Force. President Donald Trump, speaking from his Mar-a-Lago residence, described the target as a \"heavily fortified military fortress\" in the center of Caracas. \"He was trying to get into [a safety space], but he got bum-rushed so fast that he didn't get into that,\" the President told reporters, adding that U.S. forces had even built a replica of the building to practice the extraction. While the operation lasted less than 30 minutes, it involved significant air strikes that disabled Venezuela's electrical grid and radar systems to facilitate the snatch-and-grab.\n\nAs Maduro remains in U.S. custody, Venezuela has been plunged into a leadership crisis. The Constitutional Chamber of the country's Supreme Court has ordered Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez to assume the role of interim president to ensure \"administrative continuity.\" Rodr\u00edguez, currently believed to be in Russia, has characterized the capture as a \"barbaric and illegal kidnapping.\" Meanwhile, President Trump has asserted that the United States will \"run the country\" on a temporary basis until a stable transition can be arranged, with a particular focus on reviving the nation's oil infrastructure. US Releases Video of Arrested Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Show Staging 'Perp-Walk' in Handcuffs.\n\nThe capture has drawn sharp condemnation from traditional allies of the Maduro administration. China's Foreign Ministry called for Maduro's \"immediate release,\" citing a violation of international law. Conversely, regional leaders like Argentina's Javier Milei celebrated the move as a victory for freedom. In the U.S., the operation has divided lawmakers. While many Republicans praised the \"decisive leadership\" of the administration, several Democratic leaders have questioned the legal authority of a military-led regime change conducted without congressional approval.",

A CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped track Maduro's location in the lead-up to the operation, part of an extensive intelligence network.\n\nSpeaking alongside Trump on Saturday, Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Operation Absolute Resolve took months of planning and rehearsals, with forces waiting for favorable weather. More than 150 aircraft were used to transport the extraction team into the capital.\n\nThe team entered Maduro's compound -- a \"house that was more like a fortress,\" according to Trump -- at 02:01 local time (06:01 GMT), with the lights in Caracas reportedly turned off by US forces. Trump said Maduro attempted to reach a steel-fortified safe room but was unable to close the door.\n\nThe president added that no US forces were killed and there were \"few\" injuries during the operation, which he said he watched live. Maduro and his wife were then placed on a ship and subsequently a plane, which landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York, about 60 miles (97 km) north of Manhattan.",

      "body": "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, arrived at Stewart International Airport in New York State after being seized during a US military operation in Caracas, according to reports.\n\nAerial footage showed Maduro disembarking from the aircraft accompanied by several individuals amid heavy security measures. He is expected to be transferred by helicopter to New York City to stand trial under an indictment announced by Washington, which US authorities claim is linked to drug trafficking allegations.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the US military operation against Venezuela resulted not only in the arrest of the Venezuelan president and his wife but also in the deaths of 40 people, including civilians and soldiers. US officials said more than 150 American aircraft were deployed to destroy Venezuelan air defense systems, enabling military helicopters to land forces that carried out the assault on Maduro's residence.\n\nUS President Donald Trump publicly announced the capture of Maduro and his wife, as well as the destruction of key military and civilian facilities in Venezuela, warning that additional strikes could follow if deemed necessary. The remarks were made during a joint press conference with the US secretaries of defense and state and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, following the attack on the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, and other regions of the country.\n\nVenezuelan Officials and Public React\n\nIn her first response following Trump's statements, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez called for calm and national unity to defend the country. She rejected what she described as the violence inflicted by the US president on Venezuela, saying the American military assault represents a grave stain on the course of bilateral relations.\n\nVenezuelans took to the streets to denounce what they described as a US assault on their country's sovereignty, demanding the return of their president and accountability for Washington over what they called a crime that violates international laws and norms and disregards the will of the Venezuelan people. During the demonstrations, the governor of Caracas said the Venezuelan people would not yield or submit, stressing that Washington is determined to seize Venezuela's resources -- an outcome, she said, that the people would not allow.\n\nUS authorities later announced that Maduro has been placed in a detention facility in the Brooklyn borough of New York, ahead of his scheduled appearance before a federal court in Manhattan on Monday. The case centers on charges related to narcotics and weapons offenses. The US Department of Justice also released an indictment naming Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\nMaduro and his wife were escorted to offices of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in New York, where he underwent an initial interrogation hours after arriving aboard an aircraft at a National Guard military base north of the city.\n\nFootage circulating on social media showed the Venezuelan president surrounded by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents as he disembarked from a US government aircraft at Stewart Air Base before being transferred to the detention center.\n\nMaduro is expected to later appear before a federal judge to respond to charges that include what Washington describes as \"narco-terrorism\" and the export of cocaine to the United States -- allegations he has repeatedly denied.",

      "body": "Maduro and Flores held in Brooklyn on drug and weapons charges\n\nFollowing the dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from his home in a night-time raid at his military base on Saturday, the White House on Sunday mocked him for daring the US President Donald Trump last August to come and \"get me\".\n\nNicolas Maduro was captured by US forces during a raid on Saturday and flown to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges. Months before his arrest, the 63-year-old leader had openly challenged Donald Trump to arrest him, issuing a defiant dare from Venezuela's presidential palace.\n\n\"Come get me. I will wait for him here in Miraflores. Don't be late, coward,\" Maduro said in a fiery speech in August after Washington increased the reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\nOn Sunday, the White House mocked Maduro in a video shared on X. The clip featured a montage of Maduro's past taunts toward the US alongside footage from the operation that led to the capture of him and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\nThe 61-second video also included scenes from Trump's press briefing on the Venezuela strikes, during which US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said Maduro \"had his chance - until he didn't.\"\n\n\"He f****d around and found out,\" Hegseth was heard saying in the video, which has since gone viral.\n\nMaduro and Flores were captured during a surprise pre-dawn operation at their residence inside Caracas' high-security Fort Tiuna military compound, where they were reportedly asleep. The couple has been charged with \"narco-terrorism,\" importing large quantities of cocaine into the US, and illegal weapons possession, and are currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.",

      "body": "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife were brought to the United States following a U.S.-led operation and are expected to appear before a federal judge in Manhattan on Monday, according to U.S. officials.\n\nMaduro was transferred to New York as part of an operation coordinated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). After initial processing in Manhattan, the couple was taken under heavy security to the Metropolitan Federal Detention Center in Brooklyn, where they are currently being held.\n\nAccording to U.S. sources, Maduro was taken from Venezuela's capital, Caracas, in the early hours of Saturday aboard a U.S. military helicopter. He was first transported to an undisclosed location in the Caribbean and then transferred to the U.S. Navy vessel USS Iwo Jima. From there, Maduro was flown to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base before being taken to Stewart Air National Guard Base in upstate New York.\n\nAfter landing, Maduro and his wife were flown by helicopter to Manhattan under intense security measures.\n\nUpon arrival in Manhattan, the couple was taken to the DEA's New York field office, where standard procedures including identity verification and fingerprinting were conducted. Authorities temporarily restricted access around the building as part of heightened security protocols.\n\nFollowing the completion of initial procedures, Maduro and his wife were transferred to the Metropolitan Federal Detention Center in Brooklyn. Security forces escorted the couple through a secondary entrance, while armored vehicles, long-gun patrols, and police helicopters were deployed around the facility.\n\nU.S. media reported that Maduro is scheduled to appear before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Details regarding the charges and the scope of the indictment were later shared by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi via social media.\n\nAuthorities have not yet released the full indictment publicly, but officials confirmed that the case will be handled at the federal level.\n\nFollowing reports of Maduro's detention, a group gathered outside the Brooklyn facility, waving Venezuelan flags and chanting slogans celebrating what they described as the end of dictatorship in their country. Demonstrators remained in the area late into the night.\n\nSecurity measures around the detention center were further reinforced, with frequent identity checks and expanded police presence in surrounding streets. Officials said the measures were intended to prevent unrest and ensure the safety of detainees and personnel.\n\nLater, the White House's official rapid response account shared a video described as showing Maduro under police escort inside a DEA facility in Manhattan. The footage shows Maduro walking along a corridor marked \"DEA NYD,\" wearing a black hooded sweatshirt.\n\nThe video was captioned with the phrase \"Suspect walked\", and includes a brief moment in which Maduro is heard saying, \"Happy New Year.\" The footage quickly circulated on social media, drawing widespread attention and debate.\n\nFollowing Maduro's removal, Venezuela's Supreme Court reportedly ordered the vice president to assume presidential duties on an interim basis. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the future of Venezuela would depend on decisions made by U.S. President Donald Trump, saying, \"The conditions will be set by President Trump.\"\n\nThe developments mark a dramatic escalation in the Venezuela crisis and have drawn international attention as the legal process in New York moves forward.",

      "body": "Credit: Getty images, AP The United States launched pre-dawn airstrikes on Venezuela early Saturday, triggering explosions across Caracas and setting the stage for the capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, a dramatic escalation that was confirmed hours later by US President Donald Trump. Venezuelan authorities declared a state of emergency as panic spread across the capital following the attacks, which killed at least 40 people.\n\nHow the operation unfolded:\n\nUS strikes rock Caracas\n\nAccording to AFP, at least seven loud explosions were heard across Caracas around 2.00 am local time (0600 GMT), with the first blast occurring shortly before 1.50 am. Air sirens, low-flying aircraft and widespread power outages added to the chaos as residents rushed into the streets.\"One was so strong, my window was shaking after it,\" CNN correspondent Osmary Hern\u00e1ndez said. Reuters reported that smoke was seen rising from southern Caracas near a major military base, while witnesses described aircraft flying overhead. Videos of the blasts quickly surfaced on social media.Trump later confirmed the military action, saying the United States had ordered strikes on targets inside Venezuela, including military facilities.Maduro captured after overnight operation\n\nAccording to US officials cited by CBS News, Maduro was taken into custody by members of Delta Force, the US military's elite special mission unit, during a night-time operation in Caracas.CBS reports suggested the operation may also have involved the elite army helicopter unit Night Stalkers, whose pilots participated in the 2011 raid that killed al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden. Speaking on Saturday afternoon, US President Donald Trump and senior military officials provided further details of how Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were tracked to a \"very highly guarded ... fortress\" during what Trump called Operation Absolute Resolve. \"They got taken out in a matter of seconds,\" Trump said, claiming Maduro had tried to flee into a safe room. \"He was trying to get into it, but he got bum rushed so fast that he didn't get into that.\" He added that while some US forces had been hit, none were killed, and troops had used a blowtorch to cut through steel doors. Gen Dan Caine, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the special forces team reached Maduro's residence at around 2 am, engaging in \"multiple self-defence engagements\" during their escape from Venezuelan territory, according to US officials.Confirming the action, US President Donald Trump said the United States had carried out a \"large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader\". In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country.\"He added that the operation was conducted \"in conjunction with US Law Enforcement\" and said further details would be shared at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago.As reports of Maduro's capture spread, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez said the whereabouts of the president and his wife were unknown, adding that authorities were demanding \"proof of life\", according to the Associated Press. From Caracas to US custody\n\nUS authorities later detailed Maduro's transfer out of Venezuela. Officials said he was seized in Caracas and flown by US helicopter in the early hours of Saturday. He was first taken to the USS Iwo Jima at an undisclosed location in the Caribbean Sea, before being transferred to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.From there, Maduro was flown to Stewart Air Force Base in New York State's Orange County and then taken by helicopter into New York City. In total, he travelled about 2,100 miles (3,300 kilometres) from Venezuela to the United States.Video footage released later on Saturday showed Maduro arriving handcuffed and escorted by US officials. Trump also shared an image showing the Venezuelan leader handcuffed and blindfolded aboard the USS Iwo Jima, captioned: \"Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.\"According to the BBC, a motorcade believed to be carrying Maduro was seen leaving the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) headquarters in Manhattan before heading to a heliport. Three helicopters were later seen flying down the Hudson River past the Statue of Liberty before landing. US officials said Maduro and Flores were taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.Charges filed in New York\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that Maduro and Flores have been indicted in the Southern District of New York. The charges include conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess such weapons against the US.US media reports said the booking process has begun, including fingerprinting, biometric data collection, mugshots and medical examinations. The couple are expected to be formally produced in court, possibly as early as Monday.Speaking later on Fox and Friends Weekend, Trump said the operation lasted less than 30 minutes and had been rehearsed in advance, claiming Maduro had been heavily guarded inside a fortified palace. The White House's Rapid Response account later posted a video appearing to show a \"perp walk\" of the ousted Venezuelan leader at the DEA office in Manhattan.Governments across the world reacted with alarm and condemnation after the US operation in Venezuela, with many warning of regional instability and violations of international law. The European Union called for restraint and strict adherence to the UN Charter, with its top diplomat Kaja Kallas stressing that international law must be respected even as the bloc said it does not recognise Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's legitimacy. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said all countries must uphold international law and underlined that the UK was not involved in the action. Russia described the incident as an abduction and an \"act of armed aggression\", demanding immediate clarification, while Spain urged de-escalation and offered to help mediate a democratic and peaceful solution. In Latin America, Colombia called the move an assault on regional sovereignty and sought an urgent UN Security Council meeting, while Mexico warned the strikes seriously jeopardised regional stability. Iran and Cuba strongly condemned what they called a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty, with Havana denouncing \"state terrorism\" against the Venezuelan people. China, meanwhile, urged Washington to immediately release Maduro and his wife, ensure their safety, and resolve the crisis through dialogue and negotiation, saying their removal violated international law and established norms\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

      "title": "White House account posts 'perp walk' by Venezuela's Maduro",
      "body": "A still image from video posted by the White House's Rapid Response 47 account on X.com, which originated from the @PaulDMauro account, shows Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro being walked in custody down a hallway at the offices of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in New York City, US, January 3, 2026. X/@RapidResponse47\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was in a New York detention centre on Sunday after President Donald Trump ordered an audacious US raid to capture the South American leader and take control of the country and its vast oil reserves.\n\nWhite House's Rapid Response 47 account on X posted a video captioned \"perp walked\", showing Maduro being walked in custody down a hallway at the offices of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in New York City.\n\nAs part of the dramatic operation early on Saturday that knocked out electricity in parts of Caracas and included strikes on military installations, US Special Forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and transported them via helicopter to a US Navy ship offshore before flying them to the US.\n\n\"We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump told a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nFor months, his administration criticised Maduro, 63, over what it called his involvement in shipping drugs to the US. It ramped up pressure with a massive military build-up in the Caribbean and a series of deadly missile attacks on alleged drug-running boats.\n\nWhile many Western allies oppose Maduro and say he stole Venezuela's 2024 election, Trump's boasts about controlling the nation and exploiting its oil revived painful memories of past US interventions in Latin America, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSome legal experts questioned the legality of an operation to seize the head of state of a foreign power, while Democrats who said they were misled during recent Congress briefings demanded a plan for what is to follow.\n\nTrump said as part of the takeover, major US oil companies would move back into Venezuela, which has the world's largest oil reserves, and refurbish badly degraded oil infrastructure, a process experts said could take years.\n\nHe said he was open to sending US forces into Venezuela. \"We're not afraid of boots on the ground,\" he said.\n\nA plane carrying Maduro landed near New York City on Saturday night, and he was helicoptered to the city before being taken by a large convoy to the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn under a heavy police guard.\n\nImages released by US authorities showed the leader handcuffed and blindfolded during the flight, and later being led down a hallway at the offices of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, where he was heard wishing a \"happy New Year.\"\n\nIndicted on various federal charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, Maduro expected to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court on Monday, according to a Justice Department official.\n\nIt is unclear how Trump plans to oversee Venezuela. US forces have no control over the country, and Maduro's government appears not only to still be in charge but to have no appetite for cooperating with Washington.\n\nMaduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared on Venezuelan television on Saturday afternoon with other top officials to decry what she called a kidnapping.\n\n\"We demand the immediate release of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores,\" Rodriguez said, calling Maduro \"the only president of Venezuela.\" A Venezuelan court ordered Rodriguez to assume the position of interim president.\n\nTrump did not say who will lead Venezuela when the US cedes control, but appeared to rule out working with opposition figure and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado, widely seen as Maduro's most credible opponent.\n\n\"She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country,\" he said.\n\nIn Venezuela, the streets were mostly calm after a rush for groceries and fuel. Soldiers patrolled some parts and small pro-Maduro crowds gathered in Caracas.\n\nOthers expressed relief. \"I'm happy, I doubted for a moment that it was happening because it's like a movie,\" said merchant Carolina Pimentel, 37, in the city of Maracay.\n\nMany Venezuelan migrants around the world erupted in celebration.\n\n\"We are free. We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country,\" said Khaty Yanez, who lives in the Chilean capital Santiago, one of an estimated 7.7 million Venezuelans - 20% of the population - who have left the country since 2014.\n\nThe UN Security Council planned to meet on Monday to discuss the actions, which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as \"a dangerous precedent.\" Russia and China, both major backers of Venezuela, criticised the US.\n\n\"China firmly opposes such hegemonic behaviour by the US., which seriously violates international law, violates Venezuela's sovereignty and threatens peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean,\" China's foreign ministry said.\n\nTrump's comments about an open-ended military presence in Venezuela echoed the rhetoric around past invasions in Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which ended in American withdrawals after years of costly occupation and thousands of US casualties.\n\nA US occupation \"won't cost us a penny\" because the United States would be reimbursed from the \"money coming out of the ground,\" Trump said, referring to Venezuela's oil reserves, a subject he returned to repeatedly during Saturday's press conference.\n\nTrump's focus on foreign affairs provides fuel for Democrats to criticise him ahead of midterm congressional elections in November, when control of both houses of Congress is at stake, with Republicans controlling both by narrow margins.\n\nOpinion polls show the top concern for voters is high prices at home, not foreign policy.\n\nTrump also runs the risk of alienating some of his own supporters, who have backed his \"America First\" agenda and oppose foreign interventions.",

      "body": "U.S. Army Delta Force troops had captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia, from their Caracas home late Friday night.\n\nA grim-looking Nicol\u00e1s Maduro appeared publicly for the first time since his capture, seen in handcuffs being escorted through New York City's DEA headquarters, during which he strangely wished agents a \"Happy New Year,\" according to video footage and photos. Maduro looked surprisingly calm as agents escorted him through the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in Manhattan.\n\nU.S. Army Delta Force troops had captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia, from their Caracas home late Friday night. The ousted Venezuelan dictator was dressed in black sweatpants and a black cap, gripping a water bottle as he was led through the Chelsea facility before being transferred to Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center late Saturday night.\n\nFace of Evil\n\nThe deposed leader, dressed down in white socks and jail-issued flip-flops, was heard calmly telling the agents around him, \"Good night, happy New Year,\" according to footage shared by the White House on X. The post was bluntly labeled a \"perp walk.\"\n\nThe couple was dragged from the South American nation and flown to New York late Saturday night to face federal narco-terrorism charges and other offenses in the Southern District of New York.\n\nAfter arriving in the city, they were processed at the Drug Enforcement Administration's headquarters, then transported by helicopter past the Statue of Liberty to a Brooklyn jail, where crowds of cheering onlookers had gathered to celebrate their capture.\n\n\"It's such a joy to see the dictator fall, but the regime hasn't fallen yet,\" Venezuelan national Ronny Chirinos, who relocated from Maracay to the city three years ago due to Maduro's regime, told The Post.\n\n\"I want everything to fall. That there is no one left.\n\nOthers in the crowd hailed Trump for authorizing the high-risk military operation, erupting into loud cheers and chants of \"down with the dictator\" and \"dirty scumbag\" outside the detention facility.\n\nMaduro and Flores are expected to make their first appearance in federal court as soon as Monday.\n\nVenezuela in Doldrums\n\nTrump said the United States would take over governing Venezuela indefinitely, brushing aside the idea of popular opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado stepping in and claiming she \"does not have the support.\"\n\nVideo later showed the moment Maduro and Flores arrived in the U.S., landing aboard a white FBI Boeing 757 at Stewart Air National Guard Base in upstate New York around 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Figures believed to be the couple, surrounded by officials, were seen slowly exiting the aircraft before being whisked away by helicopter to New York City.\n\nBecause the footage was shot at night, details were hard to make out, but Maduro appeared to be in handcuffs as he was escorted across the runway to another plane.\n\nOfficials believe the pair were first flown to Puerto Rico. Earlier, a video shared by Puerto Rican broadcaster NotiCentro showed them being led onto a separate U.S. military aircraft. Filmed from several hundred yards away, the footage captures a small group boarding a plane at Ramey Base, a former U.S. Air Force runway at Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez International Airport.\n\nAguadilla mayor Julio Rold\u00e1n also posted on social media that the Venezuelan strongman had been \"transferred\" through the city, which sits on Puerto Rico's northwestern coast, roughly 600 miles north of Caracas.\n\n\"Aguadilla was the first American jurisdiction where they transferred the detainee Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\" Roldan said Saturday.\n\n\"An additional sample of geopolitical value Aguadilla has for our common defense.\"\n\nAfter being seized by the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force, Maduro and his wife were airlifted by helicopter to the warship USS Iwo Jima.",

He is seen walking down.\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro Arrest Video viral:- A video from New York showing the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is now going viral on social media. The Trump administration first removed Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power and has now taken him into custody, bringing back memories of events from 36 years ago. Almost three and a half decades ago, the US government arrested Panamanian ruler Noriega and prosecuted him on several charges, which were similar to the charges now levelled against Maduro. The US military brought Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to New York, where he is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Centre located within the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) headquarters complex in Brooklyn. A video of Maduro being taken into custody has surfaced, in which he is seen saying \"Happy New Year\" and \"Good Night.\"\n\nThe entire 'parade' from the airbase to the DEA office\n\nThe US military videotaped the whole process, from landing Maduro at a New York airbase to transporting him to the DEA headquarters. The White House's Rapid Response 47 team released these videos on social media, which are now going viral.\n\nMaduro is seen wearing a black hoodie\n\nA video from inside the DEA office in Manhattan has been shared on the social media platform X. In this video, Maduro can be seen wearing handcuffs and a black hooded sweatshirt. He is seen walking down a corridor covered with a blue carpet marked \"DEA NYD.\" In the video, he is heard saying \"Good Night, Happy New Year\" to the officers. Earlier, US President Donald Trump had shared a picture of Maduro on Saturday evening, in which his eyes were blindfolded, and his hands were handcuffed.\n\nYou might be surprised to know that there have been many such incidents in the world's political history that are remembered even after the passage of time. A recent example of this occurred when the United States claimed to have arrested Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. On January 3, US President Donald Trump stated that the US military had conducted a major military operation in Venezuela, during which President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife were taken into custody. The US has long accused Maduro of drug trafficking and having ties to terrorist groups. In 2020, a US court also filed charges against Maduro for corruption, drug trafficking, and other serious crimes.

      "body": "Former Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was seen flashing a peace sign and a thumbs up as he was led into a notorious New York City prison, where he awaits trial.\n\nMaduro was brought to the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center on Saturday, shortly after U.S. authorities apprehended him and his wife in Caracas, Venezuela's capital.\n\nDespite facing narcoterrorism charges from the Trump administration, Maduro seemed at ease during his transfer.\n\nThe ex-president wore a hoodie and was handcuffed as he entered the detention facility, known for its harsh conditions and housing several high-profile inmates.\n\nAmong his potential fellow inmates are alleged assassin Luigi Mangione and Sean 'Diddy' Combs. Notably, Ghislaine Maxwell, previously held on sex trafficking charges, has since been moved to a less severe facility.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured by U.S. Army Delta Force operatives in a pre-dawn operation on Saturday, facing extradition due to drug trafficking allegations.\n\nThey landed by helicopter in Manhattan on Saturday evening, after earlier making stops at airfields in upstate New York and Puerto Rico.\n\nHe was transported to a DEA office in downtown Manhattan for processing before transfer to the prison.\n\nThey arrived there Saturday via helicopter and motorcade before 9pm.\n\nThe high-profile center is known for 'inhumane' and 'barbaric' conditions, Axios reports.\n\nJudges have previously condemned the federal prison and even commuted the sentences of inmates housed there due to the rough conditions.\n\nCNN reported the Metropolitan Detention Center to be cold and riddled with rats.\n\nMaduro will reportedly be held there as he awaits trial. His initial hearing could begin in the next 36 hours.\n\nEarlier in the evening, Maduro was taken to be booked at the US Drug Enforcement Office, where he was expected to be fingerprinted.\n\nIn footage of the president being escorted through the offices, he appeared relaxed as officers on either side walked him down a hallway.\n\nMaduro even wished law enforcement 'Happy New Year' as he passed.\n\nHis arrest came after US forces struck Caracas amid accusations from Trump that Venezuela has been flooding the US with drugs and gang members.\n\nThe strike on Venezuela left around 40 civilians and military personnel dead, an official told the New York Times.\n\nNo US casualties have been reported but there were an undisclosed number of injuries among US troops, all of whom are reportedly in stable condition.\n\nTrump has alleged that Maduro is the leader of the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns) drug trafficking operation.\n\nHe stated that the US would take control of Venezuela for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Venezuelan Supreme Court, however, tapped Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to 'guarantee the administrative continuity' of the country.\n\nRodriguez has been critical of Maduro's capture and has called on the US to release him.\n\nShe called his seizure a 'kidnapping' and claimed it violated international law.\n\nBut the dictator's capture sparked jubilation from Venezuelan migrants living outside of their home nation on Saturday.\n\nHundreds took to the streets of cities, including Santiago in Chile, to celebrate the ouster of a leader seen as a corrupt authoritarian accused of destroying the economy of his oil-rich country while silencing dissent.\n\nThe atmosphere appeared altogether more muted in Caracas.\n\nLocals were photographed lining up outside supermarkets amid fears Maduro's ouster will lead to even greater economic uncertainty.\n\nShortly before Saturday's press conference, the president shared an undignified photo of Maduro in a tracksuit taken after his capture.\n\nHe said the Venezuelan president's wife will also be charged, but did not offer further details.\n\nMaduro was photographed wearing a heavy black plastic eye mask and ear muffs over his ears in an apparent bid to keep his location a secret from him.\n\nHe was clad in a gray tracksuit and clutched a plastic water bottle.

      "title": "Maduro Sent To US Jail, Venezuela Gets Acting Prez, Trump's Next Move: The Big Drama In 10 Points",
      "body": "China demands immediate release of Maduro and wife, urges US to negotiate\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who the US captured from Caracas in a late-night raid, was moved to a New York detention centre on Sunday.\n\nA plane carrying Maduro landed near New York City on Saturday night, and he was helicoptered to the city before being taken by a large convoy to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn under a heavy police guard.\n\nWhat next for Maduro? What next for Venezuela and the US? The top developments since the raid in 10 points.\n\n1. THE CHARGES AGAINST MADURO: US President Donald Trump said that Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were captured in Caracas during a US military operation, have been indicted on charges of alleged \"drug trafficking and narco-terrorism conspiracies\" in the Southern District of New York, and will face trial. Trump said that Maduro and his wife \"will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil\". According to an unsealed indictment shared by Attorney General Pamela Bondi on X, Maduro and Flores face multiple counts of statutory allegations related to \"drug trafficking and narco-terrorism conspiracies\".\n\n2. WHAT NEXT FOR MADURO? Indicted on various federal charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, Maduro is expected to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court on Monday, according to a Justice Department official.\n\n3. WHO RUNS VENEZUALA? Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to assume the powers and duties of acting president after the US removed Nicolas Maduro, CNN reported. The order was announced on Saturday night (local time), concluding that Maduro is in a \"material and temporary impossibility to exercise his functions.\" Rodriguez will \"assume and exercise, as acting president, all the powers, duties, and faculties inherent to the office of president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in order to guarantee administrative continuity and the comprehensive defense of the nation,\" according to the order, read by Justice Tania D'Amelio in a session broadcast by the state television channel VTV, as reported by CNN.\n\nRodriguez appeared on state television flanked by her brother, the head of the national assembly Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and said that Maduro remained Venezuela's only president. The joint appearance indicated the group that shared power with Maduro is staying united - for now.\n\n4. WHAT NEXT FOR ADMINISTRATION? \"We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump told a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\n5. TRUMP'S PLANS FOR THE COUNTRY: \"We will make the people of Venezuela rich, independent, and safe. The illegitimate dictator Maduro was the kingpin of a vast criminal network responsible for trafficking colossal amounts of deadly and illicit drugs into the United States. Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil. Right now, they're on a ship that will be heading to, ultimately, New York. And then a decision will be made, I assume, between New York and Miami or Florida,\" Trump said.\n\n6. CHINA SEEKS THEIR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: China on Sunday called on the US for the immediate release of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Beijing also asked America to stop toppling the government of Venezuela, and resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation. The country expressed serious concern over the US's forcible control of Maduro and his wife and their transfer out of the country.\n\n7. MADURO'S PERP WALK: Deposed Dictator Nicolas Maduro was seen wishing reporters and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents a Happy New Year and Good Night during his perp walk. The US released a video of captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in handcuffs staging the 'Perp-walk' as he was led to custody.\n\n8. OPERATION ABSOLUTE RESOLVE: General Dan Razin Caine, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Saturday (local time) said that \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife was \"discreet, precise\". He said the operation involved months of planning and that all aircraft returned safely after the mission.\n\n9. US-VENEZUALA CLASH: For months, Trump administration criticized Maduro, 63, over what it called his involvement in shipping drugs to the U.S. It ramped up pressure with a massive military build-up in the Caribbean and a series of deadly missile attacks on alleged drug-running boats.\n\n10. HOW THE RAID HELPS US: Trump said as part of the takeover, major U.S. oil companies would move back into Venezuela, which has the world's largest oil reserves, and refurbish badly degraded oil infrastructure, a process experts said could take years. He said he was open to sending U.S. forces into Venezuela. \"We're not afraid of boots on the ground,\" he said.",

In this attack, the helicopters were fired upon by Venezuelan forces, and attack helicopters responded. According to American sources, Venezuela's air defenses were disabled by air and cyber attacks.\n\nAmerican media wrote that Maduro and Flores were first transferred by helicopter to the USS Iwo Jima in the Caribbean Sea, and at that time Trump published a photo of Maduro blindfolded and wearing a gray suit on the ship.\n\nThen, they were transferred to a military base in Guantanamo Bay and finally arrived by plane to Stewart Air Force Base of the Air National Guard in New York that evening.\n\nAccording to reports, the Venezuelan president is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThis is the second time in South American history that the US military has kidnapped a legitimate president and taken him to New York.\n\nIn 1989, George H.W. Bush ordered a military invasion of Panama, deploying more than 26,000 troops to carry out Operation Acceptable Justice.

      "body": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife were brought to New York as part of an operation conducted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Following the initial arrest procedures in Manhattan, the couple was transferred to the New York Metropolitan Federal Detention Center in Brooklyn. Maduro and his wife are expected to appear before a judge in federal court in Manhattan on Monday.\n\nAccording to information obtained from U.S. officials, Nicolas Maduro was picked up early Saturday morning by a U.S. helicopter from the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Maduro was taken aboard the USS Iwo Jima, a U.S. Navy ship, at an undisclosed location in the Caribbean for security reasons.\n\nFrom there, Maduro was taken to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, and after a brief wait, he was transferred by another plane to Stewart Air National Guard Base in northern New York State. After landing at the base, Maduro and his wife were brought to Manhattan by helicopter under heavy security measures.\n\nAfter arriving in Manhattan, Maduro and his wife were first taken to the New York headquarters of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Here, identification, fingerprinting, and official detention procedures were carried out. A wide security perimeter was established around the DEA building, and the entrances and exits were temporarily closed in a controlled manner. While officials did not share details about the detention process, it was decided to transfer Maduro and his wife to Brooklyn after the procedures were completed.\n\nAfter the procedures in Manhattan, Maduro and his wife were brought to the New York Metropolitan Federal Detention Center in Brooklyn. It was observed that the main entrance of the detention center was not used, and the couple was admitted through a side door under heavy security measures. Security forces did not allow the filming of Maduro's entrance to the center. It was noted that security personnel armed with long guns, as well as armored vehicles and additional police units, were deployed around the center. Journalists were cordoned off in a narrow area and were able to operate in a controlled manner.\n\nU.S. media reported that Maduro and his wife are scheduled to appear before a judge at the New York Southern District Federal Court in Manhattan on Monday. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi shared information about the charges and the scope of the indictment related to the court process through her social media account.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, Maduro and Flores were brought to the U.S. under a new indictment prepared by prosecutors in the New York Southern District. The indictment states that Maduro is accused of conspiracy to import cocaine under the charge of \"drug terrorism,\" as well as allegations of possession of heavy weapons and destructive devices.\n\nAfter the news of Maduro and his wife's arrival at the federal detention center, a large group gathered in front of the Metropolitan Detention Center to celebrate the development. The group, carrying Venezuelan flags, chanted slogans claiming that their country had \"escaped from dictatorship\" and sang songs. The demonstrators continued to wait in front of the center until late at night.\n\nExtraordinary security measures were implemented around the detention center, and frequent identity checks were observed on the surrounding streets. Security sources stated that the measures were increased for the safety of the detainees as well as to prevent possible protests and disturbances. It was noted that Maduro and his wife were brought to the detention center in a white armored vehicle. During this process, the armored vehicle was followed by a convoy of security vehicles and police helicopters.",

US forces have no control over the country, and Maduro's government appears not only to still be in charge but to have no appetite for cooperating with Washington.\n\nMaduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared on Venezuelan television on Saturday afternoon with other top officials to decry what she called a kidnapping.\n\n\"We demand the immediate release of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores,\" Rodriguez said, calling Maduro \"the only president of Venezuela.\" A Venezuelan court ordered Rodriguez to assume the position of interim president.",

      "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump declares direct governance of Venezuela as Maduro faces narcoterrorism charges at facility linked to Ghislaine Maxwell\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro, the president of Venezuela, was detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in New York on the 3rd (local time).\n\nThe MDC, where hip-hop producer Sean Diddy Combs awaited trial after being convicted on charges including forced prostitution, is known for its poor conditions. Ghislaine Maxwell, an accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein who died in custody after being arrested on charges of underage prostitution and human trafficking, also passed through this facility.\n\nBased on precedents, President Maduro is also expected to be escorted outside only when necessary, such as for court appearances.\n\nAccording to U.S. CBS, President Maduro arrived at the MDC around 8:52 p.m. that day. As of now, there are no known plans for solitary confinement. The custody status of his wife, Cilia Flores, remains unconfirmed.\n\nEarlier, social media showed President Maduro arriving at Stewart International Airport in the afternoon and being moved. In the video, wearing a blue hoodie, he walked with his head down, looking at the ground, with handcuffs on his hands.\n\nIn a video later taken at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) headquarters, President Maduro was seen wearing a black hoodie and a hat, with his hands still cuffed. His expression was brighter than at the airport. He greeted reporters in English, saying, \"Good night\" and \"Happy New Year.\"\n\nPresident Maduro and Mrs. Flores were arrested during a U.S. military nighttime operation at their residence in the capital, Caracas, early that day. The charges include conspiracy to commit narcoterrorism, cocaine trafficking, and weapons-related crimes. This is interpreted as a continuation of the indictment filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice against President Maduro and several associates in 2020.\n\nImmediately after the arrest of President Maduro and his wife, U.S. President Donald Trump held a press conference and stated, \"The U.S. will operate Venezuela until appropriate political processes are implemented,\" effectively declaring direct governance.\n\nHe did not rule out the possibility of deploying ground forces. President Trump said, \"I am not afraid of 'Boots on the Ground,'\" adding, \"If necessary, a second and much larger attack is prepared.\"\n\nHe also mentioned plans for handling oil assets. He announced that U.S. oil companies would enter Venezuela under military protection.\n\nPresident Trump stated that the U.S. would sell the secured Venezuelan oil assets, saying, \"The wealth will go to the Venezuelan people, Venezuelans who have fled abroad, and the U.S. as compensation.\"\n\nThe U.S. administration announced there were no fatalities from the operation, but local media reported that at least 40 people, including civilians and soldiers, were killed. This was based on a preliminary report provided by a senior Venezuelan official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, President Trump said he watched the operation \"as if it were a TV program.\" Regarding controversies over constitutionality, he dismissed them, stating, \"It was a measure to stop drugs flowing into the U.S.\"",

The plane carrying Maduro and his wife landed at New York's Stewart Air National Base on Saturday night.\n\nAccording to US reports, Maduro and his wife arrived at Brroklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center.\n\nHowever, Trump says that the US is going to be very strongly involved in Venezuela's oil industry, and confirmed that he spoke to Maduro a week ago, telling him: \" You have to give up; you have to surrender.\"\n\nIn conversation with CBS News, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke about his visit to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where American soldiers returned after the successful mission. He stated \" I saw the best of America, I saw men and women dedicating their lives to defending our country and to accomplish that mission.\"\n\nMaduro was arrested in New York on drugs and weapons charges shortly after he landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base.\n\nEarlier, he has denied being the leader of a drug cartel. Concerning the serious incident, Venezuela has proclaimed a state of emergency, denouncing the US operation as an extremely serious military aggression.\n\nAccording to the US Vice President JD Vance in a post on X, \"The president offered multiple off ramps, but he was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.\"\n\nThere is a state of apprehension on the streets in Caracas; people are barely going out but there are long queues at pharmacies and supermarkets.\n\nWhile there has been talk for months that this could happen, the reality of yesterday's incident has still come as a shock to Venezuelans.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer says that the UK was not involved in any way in the US operation in Venezuela and that he is seeking more information to officially release further comments on the incident.\n\nHe further said, \"What I can say is that the UK was not involved in any way in this operation.\"\n\nIt is officially confirmed that Nicolas Maduro has been detained and taken out of the country now all eyes are on who will govern Venezuela next.\n\nAccording to some opposition supporters, there is a sense that a turning point has finally arrived to end a government that much of the global community describes as dictatorial, and whose leader has been indicted by Washington and other Latin American governments.\n\nAdditionally, there are rising fears that the attack and Maduro's announced departure could trigger even greater disruption in a country battered by years of political, economic, and social crisis.",

Officials launched military strikes across several key locations in the foreign territory. During the operation, President Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were captured, placed on a plane, and removed from their country to face narcoterrorism conspiracy charges early next week.\n\nMaduro and his wife then touched down at Stewart Airport in Orange County, New York. The couple were accompanied by DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) agents and taken to a DEA field office in Manhattan for processing.\n\nFrom there, officials then transferred The Maduros to the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC Brooklyn). This is the same jail that has housed El Chapo, Diddy, Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Luigi Mangione, Sam Bankman Fried, Michael Cohen, and many more celebrities as they awaited federal trials.\n\nWhite House Says 'FAFO' As Donald Trump Captures Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\n\nAfter the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, Donald Trump's White House social media team shared some interesting posts on Instagram. One of the first included a black and white image of Trump with the acronym \"FAFO (f**k around and find out).\" The White House Instagram team captioned the post, \"No games. FAFO.\"\n\nIn another post, the White House shared a clip of President Maduro previously antagonizing \"coward\" U.S. officials to \"come get him\" and \"don't take too long.\" The clip then cut to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's press conference with Donald Trump after Maduro's capture. Rubio said, \"If you don't know, now you know.\" The clip ended by playing The Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Hypnotize.\"\n\nWhile sharing a third post, the White House pieced together clips, again featuring Maduro's call to come get him, plus comments from Rubio, Trump, and more confirming his capture and consequences. The White House captioned the post, \"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had his chance -- until he didn't. The Trump Admin will always defend American citizens against all threats, foreign and domestic.\"",

      "body": "Nicolas Maduro Viral Video: Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is seen in handcuffs being brought through the Drug Enforcement Administration headquarters in New York City in a video that was uploaded online by the U.S. government's Rapid Response account. The video swiftly gained widespread notice and generated strong internet reactions after becoming viral.\n\nIn order to apprehend President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were allegedly involved in drug-related criminal activities and other federal charges in the United States, the United States conducted a coordinated military operation in Caracas, Venezuela, earlier this week. The operation targeted important government and military locations. Maduro was taken into custody by US special forces after the raid was successful, and he was transported to the US under strict protection. He was led into the Drug Enforcement Administration offices in New York while shackled and under close supervision.\n\nMaduro's detention in New York places him in a rare position: a foreign head of state facing prosecution in U.S. courts. With felony charges, including conspiracy to commit narco\u2011terrorism and drug importation, already filed, his court appearance is expected soon. The operation has drawn reactions from global leaders, with some condemning the U.S. action as a violation of sovereignty and others expressing support for holding Maduro accountable.\n\nPeople are reacting with shock and humor Many are pointing out the outfit changes from casual to formal Some are joking about the situation, saying, \"When will we get perp walks of other high level criminals Others are commenting on small details like socks with sandals, while many are just amazed that a sitting president is being handcuffed and walked through a federal building The video has everyone talking and sharing their opinions online",

      "body": "Hello and welcome to the Guardian's live coverage of the US attacks on Venezuela and its capture of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nMaduro has now been brought to the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn, according to US media - more on that in a moment.\n\nHere is a summary of the most significant developments in the past 24 hours:\n\nA plane believed to have been carrying Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, landed in New York on Saturday evening. Maduro was taken to the US Drug Enforcement Administration offices and is now believed to be at the Metropolitan Detention Center.\n\nA video, posted on social media by the White House's official rapid response account, appeared to show Maduro handcuffed and escorted by agents at the US Drug Enforcement Administration offices. In the video, Maduro, who is wearing a black hooded top and hat, walks down a hallway with a carpet that says \"DEA NYD\". He can be heard saying \"Goodnight\" and \"Happy new year\".\n\nDonald Trump told a press conference on Saturday \"We're going to run the country [Venezuela] until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\". He did not give further details.\n\nThe US is going to be \"very strongly involved\" in Venezuela's oil industry after the military operation, Trump said. \"We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we're going to be very much involved in it.\"\n\nTrump said his administration had not spoken to Venezuela's exiled opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. He said he did not think she would be able to return to lead Venezuela, saying: \"She does not have the support in Venezuela. She is a very nice woman but she does not have the support.\"\n\nVenezuela's supreme court has ordered vice president Delcy Rodr\u00edguez to assume the role of acting president in Maduro's absence.\n\nAsked about Trump's comment that the US will \"run\" Venezuela temporarily, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth told CBS News: \"President Trump sets the terms ... But it means the drugs stop flowing. It means the oil that was taken from us is returned, ultimately, and that criminals are not sent to the United States.\"\n\nThe UN security council is due to hold an emergency meeting on Monday.\n\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela, his spokesperson has said, and considered the US intervention \"a dangerous precedent\".\n\nThe New York Times reported that at least 40 people, including civilians and soldiers, were killed in Saturday's attack. The estimate came from a senior Venezuelan official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",

In two other photos, he is being escorted by a large number of DEA agents in a perp walk following his arrival at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York.\n\nMaduro was then transported to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, where he will await trial.

Sky News correspondent James Matthews reported that the figure descending the steps \"appears to be barefoot... with his head covered.\" He was restrained by both handcuffs and leg irons.\n\nOfficials moved the Venezuelan leader across the tarmac toward a waiting helicopter. Authorities expect the aircraft to transport him to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Two individuals in DEA uniforms filmed the scene as a second person followed Maduro down the aircraft stairs minutes later.\n\nMaduro faces federal drug and weapons charges in a Manhattan court next week.

Following the arrests, Trump stated the US will \"run\" the country until a political transition occurs. He claimed major American oil firms stand ready to invest billions to restore infrastructure.\n\nVenezuela holds the world's largest proven oil reserves. Trump argues this wealth ensures US involvement carries no financial burden, as future production revenues will fund the operation.\n\nHegseth Praises \"Bold\" Military Action\n\nUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth described the removal of Maduro as the \"exact opposite\" of the Iraq invasion.

      "body": "The US government released a video showing captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in handcuffs, staging what American officials described as a \"perp-walk\" as he was led into custody.\n\nIn the footage shared on X by Rapid Response 47, Maduro is seen being escorted by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officers inside the agency's headquarters in New York. He briefly acknowledges the camera and says \"Happy New Year\" before being escorted away.\n\nMaduro, along with his wife Cilia Flores, was seized in Caracas during a large-scale US military operation involving intelligence agencies and law enforcement on Saturday. The couple was flown out of Venezuela shortly after their capture, with their aircraft landing at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York.\n\nWhy is Maduro moved to New York?\n\nAccording to CNN, Maduro is expected to be transferred to the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in New York City, a federal jail that has faced repeated criticism over living conditions, power outages, understaffing and inmate violence.\n\nBuilt in the 1990s to ease overcrowding, the MDC has previously housed several high-profile detainees, including singer R Kelly, former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, cryptocurrency founder Sam Bankman-Fried and music producer Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.

Authorities are yet to decide whether proceedings will be held in New York or Florida.\n\nWhat is the political fallout in Venezuela?\n\nHours after the capture, celebrations were reported among sections of Venezuela's opposition. However, Trump expressed scepticism about opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, saying she \"lacked sufficient domestic support\" to lead the country.\n\nMachado has called for the immediate installation of Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, whom most Western governments regard as the winner of Venezuela's disputed 2024 election.\n\nMeanwhile, Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez to assume the powers of acting president, ruling that Maduro was in a \"material and temporary impossibility\" to perform his duties.\n\nMore From This Section\n\nRioters 'must be put in place', says Iran's leader as 15 killed in protest\n\nMaduro's capture disrupts Caribbean travel as hundreds of flights cancelled\n\nUS oil firms to invest billions in Venezuela: Trump after Maduro's capture\n\nUN chief slams US actions in Venezuela, says it sets dangerous precedent\n\nSouth Korean Prez visits China amid Beijing's rising tensions with Japan",

      "body": "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has been transferred to a high-security detention facility in New York following a US military operation in Venezuela, according to American media reports.He is expected to face serious criminal charges in federal court in the coming days. US media outlets report that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has arrived at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in New York City. The facility is the only federal jail in the city and is known for holding high-profile detainees.\n\nMaduro was earlier flown to a US military base before being transferred to New York, where he was briefly taken to the offices of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\nDrugs and weapons charges filed\n\nAccording to reports, Maduro has been indicted on drugs and weapons charges. He has previously denied allegations that he led a drug cartel.\n\nHe is expected to be formally arraigned before a judge in Manhattan federal court, although the exact date has not yet been confirmed. His wife is also expected to be arraigned, but her confinement status remains unclear.\n\nInside metropolitan detention center\n\nThe Metropolitan Detention Center has previously housed inmates such as Ghislaine Maxwell, R Kelly, and most recently Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.\n\nThe jail has a reputation for harsh conditions and has faced allegations of violence and inadequate supervision. Past cases include reports of detainees being denied medical care after serious injuries.\n\nWhat happens next in court?\n\nLegal experts say Maduro will soon face his first court appearance. Leon Fresco, a former deputy assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice, said Maduro will likely be arraigned early next week.\n\n\"He will have to plead guilty or not guilty, and most people plead not guilty in this situation,\" Fresco said. He added that Maduro is unlikely to be granted bail due to the risk of flight.\n\nFresco noted that Maduro may request a speedy trial, which would require proceedings within 70 days. If waived, the trial could stretch over one to two years.\n\nHe also said the case could mirror the prosecution of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, whose jurisdictional challenges were rejected by US courts.\n\nTrump claims 'unprecedented' military operation\n\nUS President Donald Trump said the arrest followed a major US military operation in Venezuela carried out on his direct orders. Speaking at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump described the action as a \"spectacular assault\" involving air, land, and sea forces.\n\nTrump claimed the operation rendered Venezuelan defenses powerless and compared it to past US strikes on Iran. He also shared an image of Maduro on his Truth Social account shortly before the announcement.\n\nTrump said the Venezuela strike was part of a broader show of US military strength, referencing Operation Hammer, which he claimed eliminated Iran's nuclear capability.\n\nHe described Caracas as being plunged into darkness during the operation, attributing it to US technical superiority. The developments have drawn international reaction, with some countries condemning the US action and others urging restraint.",

Reports say the couple was asleep at their home inside the high-security Ft Tiuna military complex when the raid happened.\n\nThe White House's official rapid response account, Rapid Response 47, shared a video on X showing Maduro being walked through the DEA office in lower Manhattan.

He was first taken to a US military base on Saturday evening and later moved to New York City.\n\nMaduro and his wife have been charged with narco-terrorism, sending large amounts of cocaine into the US, and possessing illegal weapons.\n\nFrom the DEA office, Maduro was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, the same jail where rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was held during his trial last year.\n\nThe US carried out an operation called \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" to arrest Maduro. Elite US forces, including the Army's Delta Force, took about 30 minutes to detain him.\n\nReports say Maduro tried to escape to a reinforced safe room but was pulled into custody.\n\nThe US said no American soldiers were killed during the operation.",

The White House released footage of Maduro walking with two DEA agents, wearing a black hooded T-shirt, black pants, socks, and black sandals. The video appears to have been filmed inside the DEA headquarters. He spoke in English to those around him, saying, \"Have a good night and a happy new year.\"\n\nAfter completing the procedures at the DEA, the Maduro couple boarded a helicopter again and were transported to the MDC in Brooklyn.

      "body": "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has been arrested and brought to the United States, arriving in New York in handcuffs. He and his wife, Cilia Flores, face multiple charges including narco-terrorism and cocaine importation. The operation involved a complex transfer from Venezuela to a US naval base before reaching New York for legal proceedings.\n\nThe first video showing Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro arriving in the United States surfaced on Saturday (local time). The footage shows Maduro in handcuffs, escorted by US officials as he disembarked from a helicopter at Stewart Airport in New York.\n\nEarlier, Donald Trump had shared the first image of Maduro in custody, which showed him handcuffed and blindfolded aboard a US warship. According to US authorities, Maduro was captured by American forces during a late-night operation in Venezuela and flown out of the country in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nAfter landing in New York, a motorcade believed to be transporting Maduro was seen leaving the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) headquarters along Manhattan's West Side Highway. The convoy briefly moved north before returning to a nearby heliport, according to BBC reports. Officials later confirmed that Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, were flown by helicopter to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Witnesses reported seeing three helicopters flying along the Hudson River past the Statue of Liberty before landing, after which the couple were taken to the detention facility in a convoy of law enforcement vehicles.\n\nUS officials said Maduro was initially arrested in Venezuela and flown from Caracas aboard a US helicopter. He was first transported to the USS Iwo Jima at an undisclosed location in the Caribbean Sea, before being taken to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. From there, he was transferred to another aircraft that flew him to Stewart Air Force Base in Orange County, New York, and then by helicopter into New York City.\n\nIn total, Maduro travelled approximately 2,100 miles (3,300 kilometres) from Venezuela to the United States. US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and Cilia Flores have been indicted in the Southern District of New York. The charges include conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess such weapons against the US.\n\nUS media reports stated that the booking process for the couple has already begun. This includes fingerprinting, collection of biometric data, mugshots, and medical examinations, after which their details will be entered into the\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection system. Maduro and Flores are expected to be formally presented in court, possibly as early as Monday.\n\nThe operation reportedly lasted less than 30 minutes and took place amid explosions in Caracas and other locations. Venezuela's government condemned the action as a \"serious military aggression\" and declared a state of emergency. US officials, meanwhile, said their forces suffered minimal casualties. Maduro remains in US custody as legal proceedings move forward in New York.\n\nThe White House's official Rapid Response account later shared a video that appeared to show a \"perp walk\" of the ousted Venezuelan leader at the DEA office in Manhattan.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)",

Reports have highlighted chronic understaffing, inmate violence, unsanitary conditions, and recurring power outages at the facility. Built in the 1990s to address prison overcrowding, the detention centre has housed several high-profile inmates over the years.\n\nAmong those previously held at the MDC are singer R Kelly, former pharmaceutical executive Martin \"Pharma Bro\" Shkreli, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, former cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried and music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. Suspected cartel leader Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada Garcia was also lodged at the facility while awaiting trial on murder and drug trafficking charges, according to media reports.\n\nFrom Caracas to New York: Maduro arrest followed night-time US operation\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, arrived in New York on Saturday (local time) after being taken into custody during a large-scale US military operation in Caracas, official statements said. The aircraft carrying the couple landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York just hours after their capture in Venezuela.\n\nUS authorities said the operation was conducted jointly by American military forces, intelligence agencies and federal law enforcement.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump said Maduro and Flores have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges related to alleged \"drug trafficking and narco-terrorism conspiracies\" and will face trial in the United States. He described the arrests as the outcome of a coordinated night-time mission.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Florida, Trump claimed the operation had neutralised Venezuela's military capabilities. \"No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday,\" he said, adding that US forces, working with law enforcement agencies, captured Maduro and his wife \"in the dead of night.\"\n\nTrump further stated that Maduro and Flores \"will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil\" for their alleged role in international drug trafficking networks. While confirming their transfer to New York, he said a decision was yet to be taken on whether the trial would be held in New York or Florida.\n\nCalling Maduro an \"illegitimate dictator,\" Trump alleged that the Venezuelan leader headed a vast criminal network responsible for trafficking large quantities of illegal drugs into the United States. \"Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice,\" he said.",

      "body": "A new video has surfaced showing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro being escorted by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officers inside the agency's headquarters in New York on Saturday.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured during a surprise attack by special US forces on the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, early Saturday (local time). They were reportedly sleeping inside their residence at Caracas' high-security Ft Tiuna military compound during the pre-dawn raid.\n\nRapid Response 47, the official White House rapid response account, posted a video on X of Maduro's 'perp walk' inside the DEA office in lower Manhattan.\n\nThe video showed the 63-year-old leader, handcuffed and in a black hooded sweatshirt, walking down a hallway with a blue carpet labelled \"DEA NYD\".\n\nHe was also heard saying \"good night\" and \"Happy New Year\" to the officials in the room.\n\nMaduro was reportedly dragged into custody while he tried to flee to his steel-enforced safe room.\n\nThey were initially taken to a military base in the United States on Saturday evening and were then transferred to New York City.\n\nFrom the DEA office, Maduro will be taken to the Metropolitan Detention Centre, a federal facility in Brooklyn, according to US media. The detention centre is the same jail where rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was held throughout his trial last year.\n\nMaduro and his wife have been charged with \"narco-terrorism,\" importing tons of cocaine into the United States, and possession of illegal weapons.\n\nShow full article\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nNicolas Maduro, Venezuela, Donald Trump",

      "body": "NEW YORK (VINnews) -- Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, arrived in the New York City area Saturday evening, hours after U.S. officials said they were captured during a military operation in Venezuela and removed from the country to face federal criminal charges.\n\nAccording to law enforcement sources, the couple first landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in upstate New York before being flown by helicopter to a Manhattan heliport shortly before 7 p.m. They were then transported under heavy security in an armored law enforcement vehicle as part of a small motorcade.\n\nOfficials said Maduro, 63, and Flores, 69, were taken to federal custody for processing before being transferred to a detention facility in Brooklyn. The pair is expected to appear in federal court as early as Monday in the Southern District of New York.\n\nU.S. officials said the arrests followed a high-risk overnight military operation in Caracas, where American forces detained the couple and removed them from the country. The Pentagon has declined to release operational details, citing security concerns.\n\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed the capture earlier Saturday while speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, describing the operation as decisive and saying Maduro would face \"the full force of American justice.\"\n\nThe developments have thrown Venezuela into political uncertainty. While U.S. officials say Maduro has been removed from power, senior Venezuelan officials disputed that claim, with Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez declaring in a televised address that Maduro remains the country's legitimate leader.\n\nTrump said the United States would oversee Venezuela's affairs temporarily until a transition government is established. \"This will continue until there is a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" he said, without offering a timeline.\n\nInternational reaction continued to build late Saturday as governments across Latin America and beyond weighed the legal and diplomatic implications of the unprecedented capture of a sitting head of state and his transfer to U.S. custody.",

  "executive_brief": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores have been taken into US custody and are awaiting court appearances in New York, following a US military operation. This event has garnered significant media attention, with 121 articles from 87 sources published within a single day, all exhibiting overwhelmingly negative sentiment (-0.65 average score). The capture represents a dramatic escalation in US policy towards Venezuela, potentially signaling a shift towards direct intervention and regime change. \n\nThe situation is marked by strong disagreement. Donald Trump has openly advocated for US control over Venezuela and its oil reserves, while Venezuelan officials like Delcy Rodriguez condemn the actions as a violation of sovereignty. The US Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI are key players, with Maduro accused of narco-terrorism. Financially, the event centers around potential US investment in Venezuela\u2019s oil infrastructure (USD 1,000,000,000) and past rewards offered for Maduro\u2019s arrest (USD 50,000,000). Reports indicate a high death toll (80) from the US operation, raising concerns about the cost of intervention.",

      "Delcy Rodriguez condemns the US actions as a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty (\"Condemned the US actions as \"barbaric\" and \u00a0a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty.\").",
      "Mark Warner questions the legality and precedent of indicting and capturing foreign leaders (\"Does this mean any large country can indict the ruler of a smaller adjacent country and take that person out? This would lead to total chaos, this theory of the case.\").",
