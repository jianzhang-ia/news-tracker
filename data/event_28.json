      "title": "China's Trade Surplus Blows Past $1 Trillion",
      "body": "In the first half of 2025, the Trump administration made an unprecedented effort to shake loose China's grip on the American import market, employing sky-high tariffs to deter importers from buying Chinese goods. It worked, but not by reducing China's exports overall. Chinese manufacturers are making and shipping more finished goods than ever before - but they're now selling to other countries.\n\nChina's trade surplus in goods has broken an annual record: Chinese exports exceeded imports by $1.1 trillion in the first 11 months of the year, and the gap is still widening. For comparison, this amount is roughly equal to the GDP of Poland, or the annual total of U.S. holiday season retail spending.\n\nChina's exports to the U.S. market dropped by about 20 percent year-over-year, but this was more than offset by a substantial growth in sales to Europe, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa. Given the prevalence of re-packaging and transshipment operations in overseas markets, some of this cargo surge ended up in the U.S. market by circuitous means - but far from all of it. China has been making inroads with consumers in alternate markets all over the world, from developing nations to high-GDP European countries.\n\nThe lopsided trade imbalance is driven by burgeoning industrial capacity, promoted and sponsored by China's government. Manufacturing rose six percent in the year through November, despite tariffs. Persistently low consumer purchasing and fierce domestic competition give Chinese companies a powerful incentive to find overseas customers - often to the annoyance of China's trade partners.\n\n\"I'm trying to explain to the Chinese that their trade surplus isn't sustainable because they're killing their own clients, notably by importing hardly anything from us any more,\" said French President Emmanuel Macron last weekend, speaking to French outlet Les Echos.\n\nAs for the U.S. market, those Chinese goods are not expected to start flooding back soon, at least not in the near term. The latest version of the National Retail Federation (NRF) Global Port Tracker report predicts continued import volume declines through the first half of 2026 at U.S. container ports. The White House's early tariff hikes may have been smoothed down, but the effects of tariffs (and tariff uncertainty) on import cargo demand will continue to be felt for months, per Hackett Associates, the firm that conducts the survey for NRF. Double-digit percentage declines in import trade volume could be seen in the first quarter.",

      "body": "TIONGKOK - China's trade surplus reached USD 1 trillion in the first 11 months of this year, even as exports to the United States fell sharply.\n\nData from China's Customs Administration released on Monday showed total exports rising 5.9% year-on-year to USD 330.3 billion in November 2025, improving from a 1.1% contraction in October.\n\nHowever, according to cnn.com, shipments to the US plunged nearly 29% year-on-year, marking eight consecutive months of double-digit declines.\n\nAlthough exports to the US weakened for most of the year, shipments to other regions -- including Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the European Union -- surged.\n\nThe gap between exports and imports widened, with China's trade surplus in the 11-month period reaching almost USD 1.08 trillion, a record annual high and surpassing the full-year 2024 surplus of USD 992 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, imports also rose 1.9% in November to USD 218.6 billion, slightly above the 1% growth recorded in October, even as the country's property-sector downturn continued to weigh on spending and investment.\n\nA one-year trade truce was agreed between China and the US at the end of October during a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.\n\nThe US agreed to reduce tariffs, while China pledged to lift restrictions on rare-earth exports.\n\nAnalysts noted that November's trade figures do not yet reflect the impact of these tariff cuts, which are likely to become more visible in the coming months.\n\nChina's factory activity has also remained subdued for eight consecutive months through November, prompting economists to argue it is still too early to determine whether cross-border demand is recovering.\n\nNevertheless, resilient export performance is expected to help China meet its economic growth target of around 5% this year, and several economists believe the country will continue to expand its share of global exports in the years ahead.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects China's export share could reach 16.5% by 2030, supported by strengths in advanced manufacturing sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics, and batteries.\n\nChina's leadership has previously set a focus on advanced manufacturing for the next five years.\n\nAn annual economic-planning meeting chaired by Xi Jinping on Monday also discussed growth plans for 2026, with an emphasis on stability and progress.\n\nDespite the temporary easing of China-US trade tensions, analysts warn the truce may not last long as relations between the two countries remain in a stalemate.

      "body": "Join the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\n\nChina's yuan has been quietly stacking up gains against the dollar this year, as policymakers lean on stable policies and a booming export sector to keep the world's second-largest economy steady.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nChina's leaders are committing to consistency, signaling they'll stick with targeted support at home rather than rolling out massive new stimulus. The Politburo just confirmed that this playbook will stretch into 2026, with export-fueled growth doing most of the heavy lifting. The strategy appears to be paying off: China notched a record $1 trillion trade surplus in November, shipping more goods to places like Europe, Australia, and Southeast Asia even while managing US tariffs. The yuan is up about 3.2% against the dollar for the year - its best run since 2020 - but authorities are still gently tapping the brakes to stop the currency from rising too fast, wary that a surge could hurt Chinese exporters' competitiveness.\n\nChina's export strength is shaking up global markets, as firms shift focus toward Europe and Southeast Asia to dodge trade flare-ups. The yuan's 3.2% rally is building investor confidence in China's adaptability, but also reflects regular interventions by state banks to steady the ship. Investors will be keeping tabs on upcoming Chinese inflation and credit figures, which could tip policymakers' hands on whether they stick to their current strategy or switch gears if fresh risks emerge.\n\nThe bigger picture: Trade flows redraw the global landscape.\n\nChina racking up over $1 trillion in annual trade surplus underlines big changes in worldwide supply chains. By rerouting exports away from the US and toward new partners, China's entrenching its powerhouse status even as protectionist policies rise. With a tight focus on stability and fresh trading routes, the next policy twist could depend on whether international demand keeps up or if the global backdrop shifts gears again.",

      "title": "Yuan should be used for more imports, former PBOC adviser says",
      "body": "China plans to boost domestic demand and promote more yuan-based financial products to reduce its dependence on exports and strengthen the yuan's international standing.\n\nA former central bank adviser suggests that China should increase imports and settle payments in yuan to help balance its foreign trade and expand the currency's global use.\n\nLiu Shijin, a former member of the People's Bank of China's monetary policy committee, says that China's trade strategy needs significant adjustments over the next five years to achieve a basic balance between imports and exports.\n\nCurrently serving as the Chinese Chief Advisor for the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED), among other positions, Liu noted that China should undertake a major shift in its foreign trade strategy over the next five years.\n\nWhile the country adopts this change, he emphasized the importance of achieving a basic balance between what is imported into China and what it exports. Liu made these remarks during a speech last week.\n\nLiu pointed out that China had a trade surplus of approximately $1 trillion in 2024. Therefore, he elaborated that, \"If China can bring in more goods and services worth that amount and pay with yuan, it will greatly increase the liquidity of offshore yuan.\"\n\nAs a prominent Chinese economist and Vice Chairman of the China Development Research Foundation, Liu noted that backing a considerable increase in the yuan's value would help establish the currency as more popular globally. He also noted that this shift in strategy will enhance the purchasing power of Chinese residents when they travel internationally and promote spending.\n\nFollowing his statement, sources highlighted that although Liu's point of view may not represent official policies, it indicates escalating international pressure on China to balance its trade.\n\nConsidering the intense nature of the situation, reports indicate that French President Emmanuel Macron recently issued a warning, implying a high likelihood that the European Union might consider implementing strong measures against China. These measures included the possibility of imposing tariffs. Macron made clear that this decision will only be applicable if Beijing continues to ignore its surging trade imbalance with Europe.\n\nThe EU's goods trade deficit with China has surged nearly 60% since 2019, and France's own trade gap with the $19 trillion economy continues to widen. Macron has long pushed for a united European approach to China and has repeatedly called for stronger safeguards to protect European industries from Chinese imports.\n\nMacron noted that U.S. protectionism and China are both striking at the core of our industrial and innovation model. And that, he said, was the worst-case scenario: he added that they had become the adjustment market. Macron warned that it was a matter of life or death for European industry.\n\nIn response, Beijing pledged to implement an effective strategy to boost domestic spending over the next five years. With this strategy, the city aims to lower its reliance on exports.\n\nMoreover, sources revealed that China's top leaders have publicly stated their intentions to improve local demand. They promised to make this plan their primary focus for 2026 to safeguard the economy from global risks associated with trade. These sources outlined this plan, citing a report from the Communist Party's decision-making Politburo.\n\nChina is currently undergoing a gradual change in its economy. To support this claim, recent economic reports noted that retail sales in the country declined for the fifth consecutive month in October. This situation occurred despite a surge in exports, which caused China's trade surplus to surpass $1 trillion last month.\n\nAt the same time, the state has reported taking a tough stance on increasing the yuan's global prominence, particularly as the dollar faces challenges due to financial difficulties and concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence.\n\nTo accelerate the process of increasing the yuan's popularity, Liu suggested that the country should launch more financial products in offshore markets and price them in yuan. Some of the products the prominent Chinese economist mentioned included bonds, stocks, funds, and derivatives.\n\nAccording to Liu, \"the share of yuan usage around the world should rise to reflect the importance of the Chinese economy better.\" Notably, he served as an adviser on monetary policy for the People's Bank of China from June 2018 to March 2024.\n\nDon't just read crypto news.

      "title": "The Trillion-Dollar Trade Shock: How Xi Jinping Outwitted Trump in the Trade War",
      "body": "Despite nearly a decade of tariffs imposed by the United States under President Donald Trump, China's trade surplus reached an unprecedented $1.08 trillion through November, marking the highest level on record globally. This figure, announced by China's customs agency, reflects an increase of 21.7% compared to the same period in 2024. The data highlights China's growing influence in global exports, as the nation continues to adapt and thrive despite ongoing trade tensions.\n\nThe resilience of Chinese exports\n\nChina's remarkable trade surplus highlights its ability to meet the challenges posed by US tariffs. The country has managed to diversify its markets, with exports to Africa up 42%, Europe up 15% and Latin America seeing double-digit growth. In contrast, shipments to the United States saw a significant decline, falling 29% year-over-year in November. This marks the eighth consecutive month of double-digit declines in shipments to the United States. However, sales to key European countries, including France, Germany and Italy, have flourished, demonstrating China's ability to focus on emerging markets as well as established economies.\n\nExperts suggest that China's strategic maneuvers have allowed it to maintain its export momentum. Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted that China has indeed found new markets outside of advanced economies. This adaptive capacity has positioned China not only as the world's leading supplier of goods, but also as an important geopolitical player, leveraging its exports to forge stronger ties with the Global South.\n\nChanges in the manufacturing sector and currency dynamics\n\nIn response to U.S. tariffs, many Chinese companies have relocated parts of their supply chains to Southeast Asia, Mexico and Africa. This strategy, known as \"transshipping,\" allows these companies to export goods to the United States while bypassing tariff barriers. By moving final assembly out of China, they can continue to supply U.S. retailers without taking the brunt of tariffs.\n\nAdditionally, the depreciation of the renminbi against the euro has made Chinese products even more competitive in international markets. As prices in China fall while those in the United States and Europe rise, Chinese manufacturers gain an advantage. Jens Eskelund, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, pointed out that the undervaluation of the renminbi poses a significant challenge for European manufacturers trying to compete with Chinese products.\n\nDespite challenges posed by tariffs, Chinese export growth remains robust. Although exports of some products, such as toys and electronics, declined to the United States, the overall loss was offset by increased sales in other regions. The shift reflects China's long-term strategy of selling at lower margins in order to gain geopolitical influence in emerging markets.\n\nThe broader implications of China's trade surplus\n\nThe implications of China's record trade surplus extend beyond economic metrics. The export boom has positioned China as a dominant force in various industries, including electric vehicles, batteries and consumer electronics. In many African countries, Chinese products have rapidly gained market share, disrupting local industries and changing the competitive landscape.\n\nWhile President Trump's trade war was intended to reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese goods, it inadvertently allowed China to reorient its export model and regain market share faster than expected. Current trade tensions have not significantly disrupted China's trajectory, as evidenced by its ability to adapt and thrive in the global market.\n\nLooking ahead, the International Monetary Fund is currently evaluating China's monetary practices, particularly regarding the valuation of the renminbi. As discussions over allowing the currency to appreciate gain traction, concerns are being raised about the potential impact on exporters and domestic demand. The Chinese government is increasingly prioritizing domestic consumption as a way to rebalance its economy away from over-reliance on exports.\n\nObserver Voice is the one-stop shop for national and international news, sports, editors' picks, arts/culture, quotes and more.

Shipments to the United States dropped by close to one-third when comparing November data to the same month last year. \"The tariff cuts agreed under the US-China trade truce didn't help to lift shipments to the US last month, but overall export growth rebounded nonetheless,\" Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said. \"We expect China's exports will remain resilient, with the country continuing to gain global market share next year. \"The role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from US tariffs still appears to be increasing,\" she added.Reuters: Damir SagoljChinese exports overall grew 5.9 per cent year-on-year in November, customs data showed, a reversal from October's 1.1 per cent contraction, and beating a 3.8 per cent forecast in a Reuters poll.Economists had expected a 3 per cent increase. China's trade surplus was $US111.68 billion in November, the highest since June and up from $US90.07 billion recorded the previous month.It meant the trade surplus for a single year passed $US1 trillion for the first time, with a month of data still to come. China has stepped up efforts to diversify its export markets since Mr Trump won November 2024's US election, pursuing closer trade ties with South-East Asia and the European Union. It has also leveraged Chinese firms' global footprint to establish new production hubs for low-tariff access. Chinese shipments to the US dropped 29 per cent year-on-year in November, while exports to the European Union grew an annual 14.8 per cent. Shipments to Australia surged 35.8 per cent, and the fast-growing South-East Asian economies took in 8.2 per cent more goods over the same period. Tumbling exports to the US came despite news that the world's two biggest economies had agreed to scale back some of their tariffs and a raft of other measures after Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in South Korea on October 30. The average US tariff on Chinese goods stands at 47.5 per cent, well above the 40 per cent threshold that economists say erodes Chinese exporters' profit margins. \"Electronic machinery and semiconductors seem to be key ,\" Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group, said. \"There is a shortage in lower-grade chips and other electronics, which meant prices jumped, and Chinese companies going global have been importing all kinds of machinery and other inputs from China.\"China's yuan firmed on Monday, off the back of the stronger-than-expected export data, with investors also awaiting policy signals from key year-end meetings. The Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged on Monday to take steps to expand domestic demand, a shift analysts say is crucial for weaning the $US19 trillion economy away from reliance on exports.The United States last tested a nuclear weapon in 1992, and appears to be making the move in reaction to Russia successfully testing a Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo. Top officials are also expected to convene for the annual Central Economic Work Conference in the coming days to set key targets and outline policy priorities for next year. Economists estimate that diminished access to the US market since Mr Trump returned to the White House has reduced China's export growth by roughly 2 percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3 per cent of GDP. October's unexpected downturn, following an 8.3 per cent surge the month prior, signalled that Chinese exporters' tactic of front-loading US-bound shipments to beat Mr Trump's tariffs had run its course. Although Chinese factory owners reported an improvement in new export orders in November, they were still in contraction, underscoring continued uncertainty for manufacturers as they struggle to replace demand in the absence of US buyers. An official survey tracking broader factory activity showed that the sector contracted for an eighth consecutive month.China's rare earth exports jumped 26.5 per cent month-on-month in November, the first full month after Mr Xi and Mr Trump agreed to speed up shipment of the critical minerals from the world's largest refiner. The nation's soybean imports are also poised for their best-ever year, as Chinese buyers, who had shunned US purchases for the majority of this year, stepped up purchases from American growers in addition to large purchases from Latin America.That weakness was seen in a decline in imports of unwrought copper, a key material in construction and manufacturing. \"China's pivot to establishing domestic demand as a key driver of growth will take time, but it's essential for China to move into the next phase in its economic development,\" said Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China.\n\nChina Southeast Asia Tariffs Xi Jinping Exports Trade Surplus $US1 Trillion\n\nSimilar News:You can also read news stories similar to this one that we have collected from other news sources.\n\nSydney Hosts Australia's First Immersive South Asian Wedding ShowcaseAn innovative event in Sydney offered a glimpse into the vibrant world of South Asian weddings, showcasing traditions, connecting vendors, and sparking conversations about the cultural and financial aspects of these celebrations.\n\nRead more \"\n\nFrank Pangallo eyed deputy leadership as Liberal MPs back Ashton Hurn for South AustraliaHigh-profile SA Liberal recruit Frank Pangallo admits he sought advice about becoming deputy leader of the party, despite the incumbent in that role saying the position is not vacant.\n\nRead more \"\n\nNeser's Five-Wicket Haul Leads Australia to VictoryMichael Neser's impressive performance, taking 5 wickets, helped Australia secure a win against England.

increasing,\" she added.\n\nChinese exports overall grew 5.9 per cent year-on-year in November, customs data showed, a reversal from October's 1.1 per cent contraction, and beating a 3.8 per cent forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nImports were up 1.9 per cent, compared with a 1 per cent uptick in October.\n\nEconomists had expected a 3 per cent increase.\n\nChina's trade surplus was $US111.68 billion in November, the highest since June and up from $US90.07 billion recorded the previous month.\n\nThat was above a forecast of $US100.2 billion.\n\nIt meant the trade surplus for a single year passed $US1 trillion for the first time, with a month of data still to come.\n\nChina has stepped up efforts to diversify its export markets since Mr Trump won November 2024's US election, pursuing closer trade ties with South-East Asia and the European Union.\n\nIt has also leveraged Chinese firms' global footprint to establish new production hubs for low-tariff access.\n\nChinese shipments to the US dropped 29 per cent year-on-year in November, while exports to the European Union grew an annual 14.8 per cent.\n\nShipments to Australia surged 35.8 per cent, and the fast-growing South-East Asian economies took in 8.2 per cent more goods over the same period.\n\nTumbling exports to the US came despite news that the world's two biggest economies had agreed to scale back some of their tariffs and a raft of other measures after Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in South Korea on October 30.\n\nThe average US tariff on Chinese goods stands at 47.5 per cent, well above the 40 per cent threshold that economists say erodes Chinese exporters' profit margins.\n\n\"Electronic machinery and semiconductors seem to be key [to higher exports],\" Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group, said.\n\n\"There is a shortage in lower-grade chips and other electronics, which meant prices jumped, and Chinese companies going global have been importing all kinds of machinery and other inputs from China.\"\n\nKey meeting eyed amid US-China trade uncertainty\n\nChina's yuan firmed on Monday, off the back of the stronger-than-expected export data, with investors also awaiting policy signals from key year-end meetings.\n\nThe Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged on Monday to take steps to expand domestic demand, a shift analysts say is crucial for weaning the $US19 trillion economy away from reliance on exports.\n\nTop officials are also expected to convene for the annual Central Economic Work Conference in the coming days to set key targets and outline policy priorities for next year.\n\nEconomists estimate that diminished access to the US market since Mr Trump returned to the White House has reduced China's export growth by roughly 2 percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3 per cent of GDP.\n\nOctober's unexpected downturn, following an 8.3 per cent surge the month prior, signalled that Chinese exporters' tactic of front-loading US-bound shipments to beat Mr Trump's tariffs had run its course.\n\nAlthough Chinese factory owners reported an improvement in new export orders in November, they were still in contraction, underscoring continued uncertainty for manufacturers as they struggle to replace demand in the absence of US buyers.\n\nAn official survey tracking broader factory activity showed that the sector contracted for an eighth consecutive month.\n\nDomestic demand still soft\n\nChina's rare earth exports jumped 26.5 per cent month-on-month in November, the first full month after Mr Xi and Mr Trump agreed to speed up shipment of the critical minerals from the world's largest refiner.\n\nThe nation's soybean imports are also poised for their best-ever year, as Chinese buyers, who had shunned US purchases for the majority of this year, stepped up purchases from American growers in addition to large purchases from Latin America.\n\nOverall, China's domestic demand remains soft due to a prolonged property downturn.\n\nThat weakness was seen in a decline in imports of unwrought copper, a key material in construction and manufacturing.\n\n\"China's pivot to establishing domestic demand as a key driver of growth will take time, but it's essential for China to move into the next phase in its economic development,\" said Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China.",

      "body": "Summary\n\nChina is set to surpass $1 trillion as its trade surplus in 2025 despite US tariffs, thanks to its aggressive export expansion to other markets. It's for Beijing to address the alarm this is raising in other countries.\n\nChina's role as the world's big factory isn't weakening in the face of the US's tariff-policy pushback. Its trade surplus is set for a record high in 2025, with exports exceeding imports by nearly $1.1 trillion in the first 11 months of the year, according to official data released on Monday, topping the trillion-dollar mark for the first time.\n\nAlso Read | China's grip on key pharma inputs leaves America dangerously exposed\n\nSure, its exports to the US slumped about 29% from a year earlier in November, but this was more than offset by export expansion to other markets. To Australia, for instance, China's exports rose about 36% last month and to the EU by about 15%. Overall, China's exports recorded a 6%-odd rise in November.\n\nAlso Read | Dani Rodrik: What's the ideal policy response to China's tidal wave of exports?\n\nIts success in diversifying trade has unsettled many countries.

      "title": "Despite Trump tariffs, China's global trade surplus tops $1 trillion",
      "body": "China's annual trade surplus topped $1 trillion for the first time, a sign that President Donald Trump's high tariffs have done little to stop Chinese factories from flooding global markets with cars, electronics, machinery, solar panels and other manufactured goods.\n\nThe unbalanced global economy that the president set out to change earlier this year remains deeply distorted.\n\nSubscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.\n\nChina has responded to the highest U.S. tariffs since the 1930s by redirecting its factory output from American ports to Europe and Southeast Asia. While trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have eased in recent months, a backlash against Chinese manufactured goods is brewing in Europe.\n\nSeven years after Trump began imposing tariffs on Chinese goods during his first term to force an overhaul of China's economic model, the government in Beijing continues to subsidize manufacturing at the expense of Chinese consumers. The result is a structural tilt toward higher Chinese exports and comparatively anemic imports that is raising the chances of a confrontation between China and a growing number of its trading partners.\n\nTrump's year-long trade blitz has raised tariffs on almost all of the merchandise that the United States imports. But there has been no visible progress at tackling the main drivers of global imbalances, such as misalignments between the U.S. dollar and key foreign currencies, including the Chinese yuan, South Korean won and Taiwanese dollar.\n\n\"The administration just hasn't made a concerted push to negotiate around the issues that are central to imbalances,\" said economist Brad Setser, who served in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration.\n\nChina's currency, the yuan, has weakened in recent years even as its trade surplus ballooned. That's the opposite of what would be expected to happen. But Chinese authorities acted to prevent the yuan from rising, which would make Chinese goods more expensive to foreign customers.\n\nChina's perennial trade surplus is mirrored by a deficit in the United States. Though Trump's tariffs have reduced total trade between the two nations, China continues to ship to American customers roughly three times as much as it buys from them, according to Census Bureau data.\n\nIn April, the president declared a national emergency over the trade deficit that the U.S. has run every year since 1975. He has blamed \"unfair trading practices\" on the part of other nations as well as domestic economic policies that discourage consumption for the U.S. trade deficit.",

      "title": "China's 2025 GDP to Hit 5% with $1T Trade Surplus, Fueling Global Imbalances",
      "body": "China's Economic Ascendancy: Prosperity for One, Peril for Many\n\nChina's economy is on a trajectory that could redefine global trade dynamics in 2025, but not without significant repercussions for the rest of the world. Recent data indicates that Beijing's aggressive export strategies and domestic stimulus measures are fueling robust growth, yet this expansion appears to come directly at the expense of other nations' economic stability. As manufacturers in China ramp up production to sidestep impending tariffs, particularly from the U.S., shipments to alternative markets like Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America have surged, creating imbalances that threaten to disrupt international supply chains.\n\nThis shift is evident in November's trade figures, where China's exports grew by 5.9% overall, while those to the U.S. plummeted by 29%. According to a report from Euronews, this redirection has pushed China's trade surplus past $1 trillion for the first time, with non-U.S. markets absorbing the bulk of the increase. Economists warn that such tactics could exacerbate deflationary pressures globally, as cheap Chinese goods flood markets and undercut local producers.\n\nAt the heart of this phenomenon is China's \"dual circulation\" model, which emphasizes bolstering internal demand while maintaining a stronghold in international trade. Initiatives like \"Made in China 2025\" continue to drive innovation in key sectors such as semiconductors, robotics, and aerospace, enabling the country to outpace competitors despite external pressures. However, this inward focus hasn't diminished China's export prowess; instead, it has amplified it, leading to what some analysts describe as a zero-sum game in global economics.\n\nShifting Trade Winds and Tariff Evasions\n\nThe anticipation of higher U.S. tariffs under President Donald Trump's administration has prompted Chinese firms to accelerate shipments to non-tariffed regions, a strategy that has yielded immediate results but sown seeds of long-term discord. Reuters highlights in its coverage that exports to Europe, Australia, and Southeast Asia saw double-digit increases in November, contributing to the record surplus. This maneuver not only circumvents U.S. barriers but also intensifies competition in these markets, where local industries struggle to compete with subsidized Chinese products.\n\nGoldman Sachs Research has upgraded its forecasts for China's real GDP growth to faster-than-expected levels through 2027, attributing this to resilient exports and government backing for manufacturing. In a detailed analysis available on their site, the firm notes that these factors could propel China's economy forward even as global demand softens. Yet, this optimism for China contrasts sharply with downgrades for other economies; for instance, the World Bank has revised U.S. growth projections downward to 1.4% for 2025, partly due to the ripple effects of China's export dominance.\n\nPosts on X reflect a mix of admiration and concern among observers, with users pointing to China's projected 5% GDP growth as a sign of resilience amid trade wars. One thread emphasizes how third-tier cities like Lanzhou are emblematic of this boom, growing at rates that dwarf those in Western nations. Such sentiment underscores the perception that China's gains are increasingly viewed as losses elsewhere, fueling debates on fair trade practices.\n\nPolicy Support and Domestic Resilience\n\nBeijing's policymakers are doubling down on fiscal and monetary stimuli to sustain around 5% growth in 2025, a target that government advisers say will help combat deflation. Reuters reports suggest that maintaining this pace requires keeping economic spigots open, including investments in infrastructure and technology. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has echoed this by upgrading China's 2025 GDP forecast to 5%, citing AI-driven productivity and expanding consumption as key drivers.\n\nDeloitte's outlook for 2025 provides sector-specific insights, covering areas from financial services to energy and telecommunications. Their analysis, accessible via their China-focused perspectives, predicts that policy support will intensify, potentially leading to a rebound in domestic demand. However, this comes amid challenges like a sluggish property market and high local government debt, projected to exceed $12 trillion, which could strain resources if not managed carefully.\n\nUBS Global's 2025 outlook offers five key insights, including GDP forecasts and risks from tariff hikes. They anticipate intensifying policy measures to counter external shocks, but warn of vulnerabilities if global markets retaliate. This perspective aligns with broader concerns that China's growth model, while effective domestically, exports deflation and unemployment to trading partners.\n\nGlobal Market Ripples and Competitive Pressures\n\nThe influx of Chinese goods is already pressuring industries worldwide, from European automakers to Southeast Asian textile producers. Bloomberg's coverage of China's economic activity notes a slowdown in investment and consumption at home, yet exports remain a bright spot, potentially dragging down global growth. This disparity highlights how China's strategies are reshaping international commerce, often to the detriment of smaller economies.\n\nThe US-China Business Council reports that China met its 2024 growth target of 5% through a fourth-quarter rebound, but the 2025 outlook remains uncertain due to trade tensions. Their article details how real GDP reached $18.42 trillion last year, underscoring China's scale and its ability to influence global markets. For industry insiders, this means navigating a environment where Chinese overcapacity in sectors like steel and solar panels floods markets, depressing prices and margins.\n\nSentiment on X amplifies these concerns, with posts debating whether China's 5% growth target for 2026 signals the end of deflation or merely prolongs imbalances. Users often contrast this with contracting GDPs in Western capitalist nations, portraying China as the new economic powerhouse. Such discussions reveal a growing divide in how global stakeholders view Beijing's ascent.\n\nStrategic Responses and Future Trajectories\n\nNations are responding with protective measures, such as the European Union's investigations into Chinese subsidies and potential tariffs on electric vehicles. Travel And Tour World's piece on China's 2026 strategy emphasizes high-standard opening-up and domestic consumption as pillars of high-quality development, yet this rhetoric belies the competitive edge gained through state support.\n\nRhodium Group's research on China's post-2024 economy paints a picture of frantic efforts to prop up growth amid collapsing property values, suggesting that official targets may mask underlying weaknesses. Their in-depth report reconciles conflicting data, warning that sustained export growth could lead to trade wars if not addressed multilaterally.\n\nCNBC's analysis of November's trade data shows exports beating expectations due to a U.S. trade truce, but with shipments loading up to other markets. This tactical shift illustrates China's adaptability, yet it raises questions about sustainability if retaliatory actions escalate.\n\nInnovation Drives and Sectoral Dominance\n\nChina's push into high-tech fields is accelerating its economic edge, with investments in AI and renewables positioning it as a leader. The World Bank's engagements in China, detailed on their site, highlight projects aimed at sustainable development, but also note the global implications of China's rapid industrialization.\n\nBarclays' recent lift of China's 2025 GDP forecast to 4.8% reflects confidence in export resilience, as shared in financial updates. This adjustment comes amid broader forecasts from entities like CGTN Africa, which cite OECD projections of 5% growth in 2025, tapering slightly thereafter.\n\nFor insiders, the key takeaway is monitoring how China's manufacturing support intersects with global supply chains. U.S. Bank's analysis, though from 2023, remains relevant in discussing China's influence as the second-largest economy, advising diversified portfolios to mitigate risks from its moderating yet impactful growth.\n\nNavigating Uncertainties in a Multipolar World\n\nAs 2025 unfolds, the interplay between China's domestic policies and global reactions will be crucial. Posts on X often highlight the irony of China's youth unemployment resurgence and real estate drags, yet its overall GDP growth outpaces many peers. This contrast fuels speculation that Beijing's model, while resilient, imposes costs on the international system.\n\nExperts from Goldman Sachs anticipate faster growth through 2026, driven by exports and manufacturing aid, but caution against overreliance on these levers. Their raised forecasts underscore a trajectory where China's gains could deepen global divides if not balanced by cooperative frameworks.\n\nUltimately, the evolving dynamics suggest that while China's economic surge brings opportunities for innovation and trade, it demands vigilant strategies from other nations to safeguard their interests. Industry leaders must adapt to this reality, where one country's prosperity increasingly shapes the fortunes of all.",

      "body": "China's global trade surplus surpassed $1 trillion in November for the first time - despite President Trump's attempts to crack down on US imports from that country.\n\nSince the start of this year through November, Chinese global exports increased by 5.4% compared to the same period in 2024. Imports, meanwhile, fell by 0.6%.\n\nThis brought China's global trade surplus through November to $1.076 billion more than the $990 billion surplus recorded for all of 2024.\n\nIn October, the United States and China reached a trade deal to lower their tariff rates, leaving Beijing facing average U.S. tariffs of 47.5%.\n\nChina also pledged to buy more U.S. soybeans, delay export controls on rare earths and crack down on the illicit trade in fentanyl.\n\nChinese exports to the United States plunged 28.6% in November, the eighth consecutive month of double-digit declines. This is an even bigger drop than the 25% drop recorded in October.\n\nImports from America fell 19% in November from a year earlier.\n\nBut China continues to rely less on selling products to the United States, Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners, wrote in a note Monday.\n\nChina has a huge reservoir of domestic savings and it will again try to encourage consumers to release more to reduce their dependence on manufacturing and exports.\n\nOverall, Chinese exports jumped 5.9% in November on an annual basis, even higher than estimates and a rebound from an unexpected 1.1% decline in October.\n\nImports rose 1.9%, missing estimates of a 3% rise as the housing crisis and job insecurity continue to weigh on consumer spending in the country.\n\nThe country has offset its decline in U.S. exports with a notable rise in shipments to other parts of the world, likely to be a major concern in the European Union, where exports have jumped nearly 15% so far this year.\n\nChinese exports to Southeast Asia also increased by more than 8% during the same period, a sign that the country is transshipping its goods to other Asian countries like Vietnam before ultimately shipping them to America.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. trade deficit contracted sharply, plunging to $59.6 billion in August from $78.2 billion in July and $71.2 billion a year earlier.\n\nU.S. exports and imports each hit new records in August, at $62.4 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.\n\nYear-to-date, the trade deficit with China stands at $185.2 billion, down about 21% from the previous year.\n\nPresident Trump has said he will likely visit Beijing in April, while Chinese leader Xi Jinping appears willing to visit the United States early next year, with both sides hoping to strike a more permanent trade deal.",

      "title": "Despite Trump tariffs, China's global trade surplus tops $1 trillion",
      "body": "China's annual trade surplus topped $1 trillion for the first time, a sign that President Donald Trump's high tariffs have done little to stop Chinese factories from flooding global markets with cars, electronics, machinery, solar panels and other manufactured goods.\n\nThe unbalanced global economy that the president set out to change earlier this year remains deeply distorted.\n\nChina has responded to the highest U.S. tariffs since the 1930s by redirecting its factory output from American ports to Europe and Southeast Asia. While trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have eased in recent months, a backlash against Chinese-manufactured goods is brewing in Europe.\n\nSeven years after Trump began imposing tariffs on Chinese goods during his first term to force an overhaul of China's economic model, the government in Beijing continues to subsidize manufacturing at the expense of Chinese consumers. The result is a structural tilt toward higher Chinese exports and comparatively anemic imports that is raising the chances of a confrontation between China and a growing number of its trading partners.\n\nTrump's year-long trade blitz has raised tariffs on almost all of the merchandise that the United States imports. But there has been no visible progress at tackling the main drivers of global imbalances, such as misalignments between the U.S. dollar and key foreign currencies, including the Chinese yuan, South Korean won and Taiwanese dollar.\n\n\"The administration just hasn't made a concerted push to negotiate around the issues that are central to imbalances,\" said economist Brad Setser, who served in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration.\n\nChina's currency, the yuan, has weakened in recent years even as its trade surplus ballooned. That's the opposite of what would be expected to happen. But Chinese authorities acted to prevent the yuan from rising, which would make Chinese goods more expensive to foreign customers.\n\nChina's perennial trade surplus is mirrored by a deficit in the United States. Though Trump's tariffs have reduced total trade between the two nations, China continues to ship to American customers roughly three times as much as it buys from them, according to Census Bureau data.\n\nIn April, the president declared a national emergency over the trade deficit that the U.S. has run every year since 1975. He has blamed \"unfair trading practices\" on the part of other nations as well as domestic economic policies that discourage consumption for the U.S. trade deficit.\n\n\"This status quo of large and persistent imbalances is not sustainable,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an April speech.\n\nMainstream economists, however, say trade outcomes are driven by economic policies within individual nations. The U.S. and China, for example, are joined in a symbiotic relationship: China produces more than it consumes while the U.S. consumes more than it produces.\n\n\"Tariffs do not affect trade balances. Trade balances are driven by investment and savings rates within economies,\" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist for Capital Economics in London.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe growing Chinese trade surplus reflects weak domestic demand following the 2021 collapse of an epic property bubble, said Setser, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations. Chinese factories continued producing enormous amounts of steel, cement and household furnishings, even as the country's developers stopped building new homes and apartment towers. And cash-strapped Chinese consumers stopped buying so many foreign goods.\n\nRather than shutter factories or stimulate consumer spending, Chinese authorities effectively directed the excess production to foreign markets. Since 2017, China's trade surplus has roughly tripled in size.\n\nChina's General Administration of Customs said Monday that for the first 11 months of the year, exports increased 5.4 percent compared with the same period last year, while imports fell slightly. That meant China ran a global trade surplus of $1.07 trillion, exceeding the $990 billion surplus recorded for the whole of 2024.\n\n\"Put simply, China's price competitiveness is extremely strong,\" said Xu Tianchen, a senior economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing. \"The main reason behind the continued growth of China's exports ... is not ... because the overall size of global trade has expanded, but because China is claiming a larger share of the existing trade landscape.\"\n\nIndeed, China's exports are growing faster than global trade, which means Chinese companies are taking market share from their foreign rivals.\n\nOne reason Chinese goods carry such attractive prices is that the authorities -- by controlling cross-border capital flows and intervening in foreign exchange markets -- make sure the currency stays weaker than it would be if its value was determined by market forces.\n\nExports to the U.S. fell 28 percent in November compared with the same month last year, an even greater decline than the 25 percent annual drop recorded in October, according to the official data.\n\nThis comes after an October meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when a trade truce negotiated between the two sides earlier in the year was extended. Trump cut tariffs on imports from China, and Xi agreed to resume purchasing soybeans and to delay restrictions on rare-earth mineralsfor a year.\n\nXi signaled a willingness to travel to the U.S. early next year, and Trump has said he would probably travel to Beijing in April. Both sides aim to have a permanent trade agreement ready by then, analysts said.\n\nXi went into the October meeting feeling confident, analysts said, because Trump's tariff onslaught had not caused much damage to export-dependent China, even as its domestic economy was ailing. The latest data shows this trend is continuing, despite a blip in October.\n\nThat is partly because China appears to be \"transshipping\" more goods through Southeast Asia, despite the Trump administration's attempts to crack down on the practice.\n\nMonday's figures showed an 8 percent annual jump in the first 11 months of the year in Chinese exports to Southeast Asia, where Chinese-made goods can be assembled and shipped on to the U.S. market.\n\nChina's exports to Southeast Asia have grown strongly, Xu said. \"A large part of that is likely products that were ultimately destined for the U.S., but now make a stop in Southeast Asia.\"\n\nIt was also notable that the decline in exports to the U.S. was made up by a surge in China's exports to the rest of the world.\n\nThat will be of particular concern in the European Union, where Chinese exports rose at an annual rate of 14.8 percent in November.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, returning from a state visit to China, threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing did not take action to reduce its enormous trade surplus with the E.U.\n\n\"I told them that if they don't react, we Europeans will be forced to take strong measures in the coming months,\" Macron told Les Echos, the French business newspaper, in an interview published Sunday. Tariffs could be modeled after those imposed by the United States, he said.\n\nGermany, whose auto industry accounts for roughly 5 percent of economic output, is threatened by the swift emergence of Chinese automakers. China's global car exports soared by 53 percent in November, up from an already extraordinary 34 percent rise in October.",

      "body": "Economists say tariff cuts from the U.S.-China truce may lift exports further.\n\nHONG KONG -- China's exports rebounded in November after an unexpected contraction the previous month, pushing its trade surplus past $1 trillion for the first time, according to data released Monday.\n\nExports climbed 5.9% from a year earlier in November while imports rose just under 2%.\n\nThe customs data released on Monday also showed that shipments to the U.S. dropped nearly 29% year-on-year. But as trade with the U.S. weakens, China is diversifying its export markets throughout Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America.\n\nChina's exports had contracted just over 1% in October. November's worldwide exports of $330.3 billion exceeded economists' estimates. Imports totaled $218.6 billion for the month.\n\nThe nearly $1.08 trillion trade surplus for the first 11 months of this year is a record high, surpassing the $992 billion surplus for all of 2024, based on official data compiled by FactSet.\n\nA year-long trade truce between China and the U.S. was reached at a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in late October in South Korea. The U.S. has lowered its tariffs on China, and China has promised to halt its export controls related to rare earths.\n\n\"It's likely that November exports have yet to fully reflect the tariff cut, which should feed through in the coming months,\" ING Bank chief economist for Greater China Lynn Song wrote in a report.\n\nChina's factory activity contracted for an eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey, and economists said it was still early to determine whether there was a real rebound in external demand following the U.S.-China trade truce.\n\nWith exports still going strong, economists generally expect China to meet its target of around 5% annual growth for this year.\n\nChinese leaders outlined a focus on advanced manufacturing for the next five years following a high-level meeting in October. It also highlighted the need to boost domestic consumption, which could help address trade imbalances.\n\nA meeting of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's decision-making Politburo was held on Monday, led by Xi, to discuss economic plans for 2026, according to the Xinhua state news agency. It said Chinese leaders reiterated a focus on \"pursuing progress while ensuring stability.\"\n\nA readout from Xinhua said China needs to better coordinate its domestic economic work in the face of global \"trade struggles.\"\n\nBusinesses and investors are paying close attention to China's annual Central Economic Work Conference, which is expected to take place later this month and could map out economic priorities for the next year in more details.\n\n\"Trade diversification will remain a long-term strategy for China to fight the trade war and manage external exigencies,\" said Chi Lo, Global Market Strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management.\n\nA stable global trade environment is unlikely to last long, as China-U.S. relations \"remain in a stalemate\" despite their temporary trade truce, he said.\n\nStill, some economists believe that China will continue to gain export market share in coming years.\n\nMorgan Stanley predicts by 2030, China's market share in global exports will reach 16.5%, up from about 15% currently, fueled by its edge in advanced manufacturing and high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics and batteries.\n\n\"Despite persistent trade tensions, continued protectionism, and G20 economies taking up active industrial policies, we believe China will gain more share in the global goods export market,\" Morgan Stanley Chief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya said in a recent note.",

      "body": "A cargo ship loaded with containers leaves Qingdao Port in Qingdao city, Shandong province, China, 4 December 2025.\n\nCost photo | Nuphoto | Getty Images\n\nChina's trade surplus surpassed $1 trillion in November for the first time, despite the ongoing global trade war that has led to a sharp decline in exports to the United States.\n\nIn the first 11 months of this year, China's overall exports rose 5.4% from the same period in 2024, while imports fell 0.6%, bringing its trade surplus to $1.076 billion this year as of November, up 21.6% year-on-year.\n\nThe move comes even as Chinese goods destined for the United States fell for the eighth straight month despite a recent trade deal between the two economies, even as overall exports exceeded market expectations in November as manufacturers increased shipments to other markets.\n\n\"China continues to become less reliant on selling products to the United States,\" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners. \"China has a huge reservoir of domestic savings and it will again try to encourage consumers to release more to reduce their dependence on manufacturing and exports.\"\n\nOverseas shipments jumped 5.9% last month in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier, Chinese customs data showed on Monday, beating economists' forecasts of 3.8% growth according to a Reuters poll. This growth marks a rebound after an unexpected drop of 1.1% in October, the first contraction since March 2024.\n\nImports rose 1.9% last month, beating expectations for a 3% rise, as a prolonged slowdown in the property sector and growing job insecurity continue to weigh on domestic consumption. Growth was higher than 1% in October.\n\nChinese officials have renewed their commitment to increasing imports and working to balance trade, despite widespread criticism of its aggressive exports.\n\nThe trade data, however, bodes well for the country's growth prospects, according to Citigroup.\n\n\"We were one of the first to raise the full-year GDP forecast to 5% for 2025E in June... and the strong trade numbers since then have made us more confident in our forecast,\" Xiangrong Yu, Citi's chief China economist, said in a note. \"We believe exports will remain a key driver of GDP growth next year, amid a U.S.-China tariff truce and China's industrial competitiveness.\"\n\nTensions with the United States have led to a sharp decline in exports, although China is still able to indirectly route its goods to American ports through other countries such as Vietnam. Recent discussions have helped ease some of the acrimony.\n\nExports to the United States plunged 28.6% in November, marking the eighth straight month of double-digit declines in shipments to the world's largest consumer market, even after President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump struck a deal in South Korea in late October. Imports from America decreased by 19% compared to the previous year.\n\nWhile China's trade surplus has increased, the US trade imbalance has narrowed sharply.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $59.6 billion in August, from $78.2 billion in July and $71.2 billion from the same month in 2024. Exports reached a record high of $62.4 billion, while imports also set a new standard at $13.6 billion. China's year-to-date deficit stands at $185.2 billion, down about 21% from 2024.\n\n\"Despite the trade truce, the United States still imposes higher tariffs on China than on [many] \"This can become a future standard,\" Mr Ng said.\n\nLevies on Chinese products remain at around 47.5% according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Tariffs imposed by Beijing on imports from the United States amount to around 32%.\n\nSince the start of the year, Chinese exports to the United States have fallen 18.9% year-on-year, while imports have fallen 13.2%.\n\nDeclining U.S. exports in November were more than offset by rising shipments to other markets, including China's two largest trading blocs, the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Chinese exports to ASEAN and the EU increased by more than 8% and almost 15%, respectively.\n\nHowever, challenges lie ahead.\n\n\"Policymakers will likely remain alert to potential trade conflicts despite the tariff truce with the United States, in our view,\" wrote Yu, the Citi economist. \"Our base case scenario is that the US-China truce will hold until 2026, although it appears fragile, but that there could be trade tensions with other partners like France... as China's trade surplus has exceeded [$1 trillion]. We believe China could adopt additional voluntary trade restrictions to alleviate the trade imbalance. \"\n\nSlow start to trade pact\n\nFollowing the October trade truce, Beijing and Washington agreed to lower high tariffs on each other's goods, as well as export controls on critical minerals and advanced technology, with China pledging to buy more U.S. soybeans and work with Washington to crack down on fentanyl flows.\n\nChina's exports of rare earths accelerated in November, with 5,494 tonnes of the critical minerals, up 24% from a year earlier and up from 4,343.5 tonnes in October. The Commerce Ministry has reportedly designed a new licensing regime for rare earths that could speed up shipments.\n\nThe country's overall soybean imports rose 13% from a year earlier to 8.1 million metric tons in November, although down from October's level, signaling a slow start to fulfilling its promise to buy 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the year.\n\n\"Looking ahead to 2026, we expect export growth to remain resilient,\" Jing Wang, China economist at Nomura, said in a note. \"However, a moderation in export growth is likely, in our view. Export growth could return to the long-term average, despite China's solid progress in manufacturing, especially as more countries impose trade barriers.\"\n\nWang added that the truce with the United States may not be lost and that \"we see a second China shock fast approaching, and it may force Europe to impose more restrictive measures to protect its manufacturing sector.\"\n\nUpcoming political meeting\n\nChinese policymakers are expected to meet later this month for the annual Central Conference on Economic Work, to discuss economic growth targets, budget and policy priorities for next year. The specific objectives will not be officially announced until the \"Two Sessions\" meet in March next year.\n\nThe rebound in export growth would help ease the drag caused by weak domestic demand, putting the economy on track to meet the growth target of \"around 5 percent\" this year, said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management.\n\nBeijing is expected to keep its 2026 growth target unchanged at \"around 5%\", according to Goldman Sachs, which would require a gradual easing of policy early next year to ensure growth picks up after a likely lackluster fourth-quarter 2025 figure.\n\nChinese factory activity fell for the eighth month in November, an official manufacturing survey showed, with new orders remaining in contraction. A private survey focused on exporters showed that manufacturing activity contracted unexpectedly.\n\nThe Wall Street bank expects Chinese authorities to raise the budget deficit ceiling by one percentage point of GDP, cut policy rates by a total of 20 basis points and step up stimulus measures to curb the housing crisis.\n\n]]> Weekly analysis and insights on Asia's largest economy in your inbox Subscribe now\n\nThe strengthening of the yuan in recent weeks does not appear to have slowed the flow of Chinese exports.

      "title": "\"Things Are About To Snap\": China's Trade Surplus Tops $1 Trillion For The First Time, Sparking Global Howls Of Outrage",
      "body": "With Europe finally realizing - very belatedly, as usual - that Trump was right all along in his crusade to hammer Beijing's relentless dumping of exports to flood foreign markets with its below-cost wares as China no longer has nearly the required demand for goods and services and so has to crush and dominate foreign markets by selling at far below market prices, overnight we learned that China's trade surplus in goods surpassed $1 trillion for the first time, highlighting the ongoing boom in the country's exports despite US President Donald Trump's tariff war.\n\nExports rose 5.9% in November on a year earlier, reversing October's rare decline, while imports rose by 1.9% according to data released by China's customs administration, which covers goods but not services.\n\nThe November surplus came in at $112 billion, the third-largest ever accumulated by China in a single month and far more than forecast by economists.\n\nFor the first 11 months of the year, China's exports increased 5.4% from the year-earlier period to $3.4 trillion, while the country's imports declined 0.6% over that same stretch to $2.3 trillion. That brought the country's trade surplus this year to $1.08 trillion, China's General Administration of Customs said Monday. The equivalent figure for the full year last year was just shy of $1 trillion. The record surplus comes in the wake of a de-escalation in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, which agreed a year-long truce in October.\n\nThat remarkable surplus, never before seen in recorded economic history, is the culmination of decades of industrial policies and human industriousness that helped China emerge from a poor agrarian economy in the late 1970s to become the world's second-largest economy.\n\nWhat is remarkable is that China navigated the trade war and growing economic protectionism around the world, and needed just 11 months to catapult it past the full-year record set in 2024. While shipments to the US plummeted 29% in November...\n\n.... the eighth month of double-digit declines and the biggest since August, strong growth in sales to regions like the European Union and Africa more than offset the slump.\n\nLynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING Bank NV, said the rebounds in shipments to the EU and Japan were \"perhaps a little surprising.\"\n\n\"The November export data came in a little stronger than expected, despite a further deceleration of exports to the US,\" Song said.\n\nShipments overseas - in many cases to regions such as Vietnam which then transship to the US - have boomed for much of this year, in spite of Trump's launch of a trade war early in 2025. The world's second-biggest economy has emerged largely unscathed from the standoff, as it delivered more goods to markets other than the US, which have then proceeded to ship Chinese imports onward to the US.\n\nThe display of export dominance is stirring waves of resentment abroad, especially among countries which are forced to shutter domestic industries as they fail to compete with much cheaper Chinese imports.\n\nChina's industrial heft has long been well-known to its trading partners, becoming a central point of contention in its relations with the world. Last year, its trade surplus rose to a record $993 billion. Topping the $1 trillion milestone throws the magnitude of China's export dominance into even starker relief and is likely to draw more attention to the growing imbalances.\n\n\"It is so big that it's obvious that it's not just the United States or Europe but the whole world that will have to fund that gap,\" Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told the WSJ.\n\nOn Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron, who just returned home after an otherwise cordial three-day summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing and Chengdu, warned that the EU may take \"strong measures\" including by imposing tariffs, should Beijing fail to address the imbalance.\n\n\"I told them that if they didn't react, we Europeans would be forced, in the very near future, to take strong measures and withdraw from cooperation, like the United States, such as imposing tariffs on Chinese products,\" Macron said in an interview with French daily Les Echos.\n\n\"China is hitting the heart of the European industrial and innovation model,\" he said. French officials have been particularly upset about the Chinese yuan, which has fallen by around 10% against the euro this year.\n\nDuring a joint appearance with Xi in Beijing last Thursday, Macron said that these trade \"imbalances are becoming unbearable.\"\n\nIt was a remark that reflected sharpening French demands on Beijing to spur consumption and curb exports, and one Macron repeated to rapt Sichuan students and at a gathering with French and Chinese business leaders during his fourth trip to the country as president.\n\nING's Song added that if \"the EU indeed does follow suit with tariffs, it would represent a significant risk to the external demand outlook for China.\"\n\nFrance's goods trade deficit with China has doubled in the past decade to \u20ac47bn in 2024. French investment in China over the same period is nearly quadruple China's into France.\n\nParis is demanding Beijing recalibrate its trade and investment relationship with the EU, according to the FT.\n\n\"We are at the last stop before a crisis,\" a French official warned. \"If we don't change course, we will worsen global fragmentation,\" they added, suggesting Paris would have to consider \"protective measures\".\n\nMacron, who was accompanied on his trip by about 40 French business leaders, called for China to transfer technology to France in areas such as clean tech and batteries -- a stark reminder of the shifting balance of power in crucial industrial sectors. The French president also defended EU trade investigations into Chinese electric vehicles, saying the bloc was taking a company-by-company approach.\n\n\"We need more tech neutrality and a European preference\" for domestic industries such as automobiles, Macron said in Chengdu, capital of China's south-western Sichuan province.\n\n\"This is not at all aggressive or protectionist. The Americans and other players in the North American market do it, the Chinese do it,\" the president said. \"The major risk for Europeans is accelerated deindustrialisation.\"\n\nBut it's not just France, says Eskelund of the European chamber, who points to a raft of bilateral trade complaints and actions leveled against China in recent months, including from not just the U.S. and its Western allies, but also from countries in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.\n\n\"I have no doubt that we'll see more, not less, in terms of all of these trade defense initiatives all over the world,\" he said.\n\nEskelund says that China's trade imbalance with the world is even more pronounced than the $1 trillion figure suggests, given the relative weakness of the Chinese yuan.\n\nWhen calculated by value, China accounts for roughly 15% of global goods exports. But in volume terms, Eskelund estimates that every shipping container being sent from Europe to China is outnumbered by the four containers heading in the other direction. In volume terms, he estimates that China accounts for some 37% of everything being exported in shipping containers.\n\n\"Concern is growing,\" he said, warning that, in the near future, we may \"get to a point where things snap.\"\n\nThe EU is considering setting \"made in Europe\" targets of up to 70% for certain products such as cars as it pushes to prioritise domestic goods and cut reliance on China. Brussels is also planning to tighten foreign investment rules to ensure Chinese companies do not gain advantage from the bloc's open market without generating benefits for local workers and sharing technology.\n\nFor its part, China continues to make promises and deliver nothing. China's commerce ministry on Friday repeated promises to eliminate restrictive measures in the domestic market and to spur consumption. But experts told the FT that Beijing has little intention of drastically altering its economic model. As a result, trade tensions between China and the bloc have sparked anti-dumping investigations in both directions.\n\nThe EU dairy sector is awaiting a ruling on a probe Beijing launched last year in retaliation against Brussels' imposition of additional levies on Chinese EV imports. China could impose tariffs of as much as 40 per cent on dairy products on top of existing duties.\n\nAs Bloomberg notes, the trillion dollar milestone reached by China follows the recent de-escalation of tensions with the Trump administration. The huge surplus also underscores how Beijing is \"struggling\" to rebalance (as in it hasn't even bothered to start) the economy away from its dependence on demand abroad, with net exports accounting for almost a third of economic growth this year.\n\n\"It does look like China's export competitiveness is still standing firm against US tariffs,\" said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale, referring to robust shipments to other markets than America. Rising trade tensions with the EU are \"a source of downside risk to watch out for,\" she said.\n\nAfter Macron failed to make any impression on Xi's export aspirations, on Monday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul arrived in China for a two-day trip, becoming the latest senior European official to visit for talks. China's exports to the EU expanded almost 15% last month - the fastest since July 2022 - with sales to France, Germany and Italy all seeing double-digit growth as Chinese exporters grab market shares from domestic producers. Meanwhile, European domestic industries are being snuffed out in one brutal, manufacturing depression as they fail to compete with Chinese substitutes.\n\nWadephul said before the trip that he'd raise trade curbs, especially on rare earths, and \"overcapacities\" in electric vehicles and steel with his Chinese counterparts. China's auto imports are down almost 39% in the year to date.\n\nShipments overseas have boomed for much of this year, in spite of Trump's launch of a trade war early in 2025. The world's second-biggest economy has emerged largely unscathed from the standoff, as it delivered more goods to markets other than the US.\n\nThe year-on-year increase in exports of electronic and machinery products rebounded to almost 10% last month, versus October's rise of just over 1%, according to Bloomberg calculations based on China's customs data. Declines in shipments of consumer goods narrowed.\n\nExports to Africa surged nearly 28% in November, while those to the Southeast Asian trading bloc gained only 8.4%, the least since February. Despite escalating tensions over the self-governing island of Taiwan, imports from Japan rose faster in November than exports to there, resulting in a $1.3 billion deficit for China.\n\nThe historic trade surplus will help boost growth in China's GDP after months of deterioration in the economy. Retail sales are coming off their longest stretch of slowdowns since 2021 while investment just shrank by a record amount. Although the Chinese economy is expanding at a slower pace in the last quarter of the year, its strong performance earlier in 2025 means the official growth target of around 5% is likely within reach.\n\nAs Bloomberg notes, foreign demand has been the one consistent driver of Chinese growth, helping compensate for lackluster private consumption at home and the prolonged slump in the housing market. But the trade picture has become increasingly unbalanced, with China's weak demand and increasingly innovative firms slashing demand for imports.\n\nWhile it's \"ultimately essential\" for China to embrace a growth model driven more by domestic demand, such a pivot will take time, according to ING's Song. In reality it will likely take years, and by then Europe's domestic production will be decimated.\n\n\"We need to see what sort of concrete measures are put into place to boost domestic consumption, and how those measures to increase win-win cooperation and establish international consumption centers play out,\" he said. \"It's quite clear at this point that relying on external demand as the main growth engine is a risky bet.\"",

      "title": "This Is How China Is Rapidly Becoming The World's Most Dominant Economic Superpower",
      "body": "I don't want China to be the world's most dominant economic superpower. I am an American, and so I want the United States to be the world's most dominant economic superpower. Unfortunately, the facts that I am about to share with you in this article cannot be denied. We consume far more than we produce, and we go into colossal amounts of debt in order to make that possible. Somehow we have convinced ourselves that this makes us an economic superpower. Meanwhile, the Chinese produce far more than they consume, and as a result they have far more money coming in than they do going out. This allows them to loan vast amounts of money to nations all over the planet, and that gives them tremendous economic leverage.\n\nDespite everything that has happened this year, China has run a trade surplus of more than a trillion dollars for the first time ever in 2025...\n\nChina's trade surplus roared above $1 trillion in November for the first time ever, despite the ongoing global trade war that has resulted in a steep drop in exports to the U.S.\n\nIn the first 11 months this year, China's overall exports grew 5.4% compared to the same period in 2024 while imports fell 0.6%, taking its trade surplus to $1.076 trillion this year as of November, up 21.6% year on year.\n\nThis is what economic dominance looks like.\n\nIf you want to have a great economy, you have got to be great at making stuff.\n\nAnd China is better at making stuff than anyone else.\n\nChina sells far more stuff to the rest of the world than it buys from the rest of the world, and that means that it has far more money coming in than it does going out.\n\nThis enables China to lend out vast amounts of cash. In fact, at this point the rest of the world owes China about 5 trillion dollars.\n\nIt is often said that the borrower is the servant of the lender, and that is certainly true in this case.\n\nThe primary reason why China sells so much stuff to the rest of the world is because they are able to make things very inexpensively...\n\n\"Put simply, China's price competitiveness is extremely strong,\" said Xu Tianchen, a senior economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing. \"The main reason behind the continued growth of China's exports ... is not ... because the overall size of global trade has expanded, but because China is claiming a larger share of the existing trade landscape.\"\n\nFor a long time, cheap human labor was China's main competitive edge.\n\nBut now Chinese factories are replacing human workers with ultra-efficient robots.\n\nIn fact, today there are more robots working in China than the rest of the world combined.\n\nAnd the gap between China and the western world just continues to grow.\n\nIf you can believe it, Chinese factories added almost 10 times as many robots last year as U.S. factories did...\n\nChina is the world's most dominant power in automating its manufacturing -- installing nearly 10 times as many robots in its factories as the United States, according to new data.\n\nLast year, more than half a million industrial robots were put to work in global factories -- with 54% of them in China alone.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Robotics, China, which is home to nearly a third of all global manufacturing capacity, installed 295,000 industrial robots, the highest annual total on record.\n\nWe are getting absolutely monkey-hammered by the Chinese.\n\nShockingly, the total number of robots that U.S. factories added last year was actually lower than the total number for the year before...\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, companies put to work just 34,200 robots last year, according to the World Robotics 2025 Report.\n\nThe 34,200 figure is 9% lower than the previous year, the report found.\n\nOf course the Chinese are not just using more robots than anyone else.\n\nThey are also producing more robots than the rest of the planet combined...\n\nThe move comes as Beijing accelerates its broader industrial strategy to lead in advanced manufacturing, a key pillar of the \"Made in China 2025\" initiative. As bne IntelliNews reported, China now produces more industrial robots than the rest of the world combined, with domestic players rapidly gaining ground in both hardware and AI-driven control systems.\n\nChina is moving beyond being just the largest market for robots -- it is becoming the core of global robot production. Chinese firms accounted for over 60% of global robot output in 2024, driven by subsidies, procurement programmes, and access to vast domestic datasets for training machine learning models.\n\nRobots don't play around on the Internet when they should be working.\n\nAnd many of the robots that the Chinese are now producing can actually recharge their own batteries.\n\nHow can human workers possibly compete?\n\nThe Chinese can now make things at about a third of the cost that we can, and that gap is only going to get wider.\n\nWhen a group of top western executives recently visited China, they were \"humbled\" and \"terrified\" by what they witnessed...\n\nWestern automotive and green energy executives who visit China are returning humbled -- and even terrified.\n\nAs The Telegraph reports, the executives are warning that the country's heavily automated manufacturing industry could quickly leave Western nations behind, especially when it comes to electric vehicles.\n\n\"We are in a global competition with China, and it's not just EVs,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told The Verge last month. \"And if we lose this, we do not have a future at Ford.\"\n\nMany are hoping that winning the AI race will halt the decline of western economies.\n\nWe have some really good AI researchers too, but without a doubt it is going to be a very competitive race.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang created quite a firestorm of controversy when he recently stated that he believes that \"China is going to win the AI race\"...\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang says Washington has lost its edge in artificial intelligence and warns that China will win the AI race. He cited the West's cynicism, export controls, and favorable energy circumstances in China as the reason, claiming it is much easier for companies to access energy in the country.\n\nThe chief of the most valuable company in the world by market cap has long been saying that the U.S. ban on chip exports is a failure, and that the spread of its advanced semiconductors is vital for it to retain its competitive advantage globally. However, the ongoing trade war between the two powers has resulted in export bans of Blackwell chips from the White House on the one hand, and the CCP banning foreign AI chips from state-funded data centers on the other. Because of this, Nvidia's market share in China has since dropped to basically zero, which probably led to Huang's statement to the Financial Times.\n\n\"China is going to win the AI race,\" Jensen commented. He also added that \"we need more optimism,\" saying that the West's cynicism is holding it back.\n\nWinning the AI race is going to require vast amounts of energy, and this is one of the reasons why China may have an edge.\n\nMost Americans don't even realize that China now produces approximately two and a half times as much energy as the United States does...\n\nMeanwhile, China has dramatically expanded its energy output. The country now produces 2.5 times more power than the U.S., despite surpassing America only 15 years ago, Lord said.\n\n\"America can't out-AI China if China out-powers us, so the U.S. must prioritize developing reliable power,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese are feverishly constructing more nuclear power facilities, and they are way ahead of us when it comes to clean nuclear energy research.\n\nThe bottom line is that we are in enormous trouble.\n\nWe need to stop watching so much Netflix and start getting serious about competing with China.\n\nIn 2026, I expect our trade war with China to continue to heat up.\n\nAnd history has shown us that trade wars have a way of evolving into shooting wars.\n\nLet us hope that a military conflict with China can be avoided for as long as possible, because at this stage I don't think that such a conflict would go well for us.\n\nBecause the Chinese have been rapidly modernizing their military as well.\n\nIn just about every area, the Chinese are either catching up with us or have already surpassed us.\n\nSadly, most Americans are so addicted to entertainment that they don't even realize that this is happening.\n\nAbout the Author: Michael Snyder's new book entitled \"10 Prophetic Events That Are Coming Next\" is available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com.

      "title": "The Second 'China Shock'",
      "body": "When President Trump imposed steep tariffs on China this year, he said they were a response to the deindustrialization of America that had accompanied large-scale outsourcing to China -- what some have called the \"China shock.\"\n\nTrump's tariffs did prompt Chinese exports to the United States to fall by nearly 20 percent. Those exports, and more, are now going elsewhere in the world. This week, China's trade surplus -- the excess of exports to imports -- officially surpassed $1 trillion, a level no country has ever reached.\n\nToday my colleague Alexandra Stevenson, our Shanghai bureau chief, writes about the second China shock, and what that could mean for the developing countries experiencing it this time around.\n\nBy Alexandra Stevenson\n\nTwo decades ago, the Western world experienced what has come to be known as the \"China shock.\"\n\nCompanies in the United States and Europe outsourced manufacturing to China until it became, in effect, their factory floor. China began exporting toys, clothes, gadgets and cars to the developed world at such a pace that it helped bring about the collapse of entire industries. Factories shut down. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of jobs were lost. Politically, the impact is still reverberating.\n\nWe're now starting to see a second China shock play out, one that looks different. This time, barred from the U.S. market by tariffs, and unable to sell enough to consumers at home, China is redirecting more of its exports to developing countries. It's also setting up its own factories in some of these countries.\n\nBut if the first China shock was largely invited by the West -- even if some policymakers have come to regret the consequences -- this one is taking place in countries that have less control over how it unfolds. Compared with the developed world, these countries are also more dependent on manufacturing to keep their economies growing.\n\nAnd so the social consequences of the second China shock around the world are likely to be as profound as the first in the West. We're starting to get a glimpse of what they might look like.\n\nA manufacturing hegemon\n\nMore than 300,000 people in Indonesia's garment factories and textile mills have lost their jobs to Chinese imports over the past two years, by one estimate.\n\nThat's when cheaper Chinese-made clothes and fabrics began streaming into the country. When one garment factory, in the city of Solo, shut down suddenly in March, 10,000 people were out of a job almost overnight.\n\nLocal businesses in Thailand have also been hurt. The central bank recently warned about the \"flooding of Chinese exports\" into Thailand and Southeast Asia, saying that the pressure had \"become more severe due to China's manufacturing overcapacity.\"\n\nIn Africa, imports from China hit $60 billion in September, already surpassing the figure for the full year in 2024.\n\nOfficial data released on Monday showed what insiders already knew: China this year has already run an annual trade surplus with the world exceeding $1 trillion for the first time.\n\n\"China's exports have been growing three times faster than global trade,\" said Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. That kind of growth can't happen without factories elsewhere closing down, he said.\n\nThis time around, China isn't exporting just cheap goods. It's also exporting the factories themselves, largely to get around Trump's tariffs, which are particularly high on products made in China.\n\nThis part has had its upsides for local economies. It's largely worked out well so far in Vietnam, in part because many of the industries that moved, like footwear and furniture, are labor intensive and need local workers.\n\nBut Malaysia is a case study in the perils of letting Chinese manufacturing become too dominant. Malaysia's fledging local solar industry was displaced by Chinese companies that built huge factories, employing tens of thousands of people.\n\nThen the United States set up tariffs taking direct aim at Chinese solar exports coming via Southeast Asia. The Chinese companies were mothballed, and today, Malaysia's solar industry is in ruins.\n\nUnemployment and unrest\n\nMany of the countries where China is sending more of its exports are going through a steep slowdown in domestic manufacturing.\n\nThey also have populations that skew young.\n\nThese dynamics may already be contributing to tension that has bubbled up in places like Indonesia, where young protesters have expressed frustration over a lack of opportunities.\n\n\"There is definitely a risk that if Chinese exports keep flooding in, you might see more and more protests,\" Priyanka Kishore, an economist in Singapore, said.\n\nThis makes for a volatile combination with the anti-Chinese sentiment that lurks in Southeast Asia, where businesses run by ethnic Chinese hold much of the wealth. Thousands of angry workers burned foreign-owned factories in Vietnam in 2014 in anger over China's attempts to control the South China Sea. In Indonesia, anti-Chinese riots broke out during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.\n\nMore than two decades ago, the West welcomed the efficiency of China's manufacturing machine, whose cheap labor enriched its businesses for years. It's been grappling with the social and political repercussions ever since.\n\nThere's a lesson there for countries in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Unlike the West, the countries bearing the brunt of the second China shock may not have asked for this. But they're going to need to brace for impact anyway.\n\nSince Israeli forces withdrew from parts of Gaza in October under a cease-fire deal, Hamas has moved quickly, sending its police forces out on the streets again.\n\nHamas now controls less than half of the territory in Gaza, with the rest occupied by Israel. Yet the militant group has managed to reassert its power. \"It's still standing,\" said a former senior official in the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency. This swift regrouping presents a formidable obstacle to the U.S. plan to rebuild a Gaza free of Hamas.\n\nAt least five people were killed and hundreds of thousands were displaced in a new wave of border violence between Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nThai fighter jets bombed Cambodian targets yesterday. The Thai military said the airstrikes were in response to an attack by Cambodia that killed at least one Thai soldier and injured eight others earlier in the day. The hostilities were a reminder of how intractable the rift between Cambodia and Thailand is.\n\n-- The Japanese festival of Shichi-Go-San -- or 7-5-3 -- traditionally celebrates children reaching those milestone ages. As Japan's fertility rate has plunged, shrines have begun honoring four-legged companions, like the three shown above. \"People have shifted from having children to having pets,\" one shrine visitor said.\n\nEarly in the war with Russia, Ukraine's recruitment ads cast military service as a way to defend civilization. But as war fatigue set in and recruitment suffered, the army began depicting service as more of a career path.\n\nMy colleague Constant M\u00e9heut explains in the video above how the ads have evolved to reflect the country's shifting moods over four years of war.\n\nLaduma Ngxokolo created the luxury knitwear label MaXhosa Africa to bring traditional Xhosa patterns and motifs into the mainstream. Along the way, he disrupted the South African fashion scene, where most designers focus on Western-style clothing, and won fans including Michelle Obama and Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nNgxokolo's commitment to South Africa and the Xhosa culture has guided his career. \"We believe that our job is not to sell and that our job is to become cultural advocates,\" he said.

Compared with the developed world, these countries are also more dependent on manufacturing to keep their economies growing.\n\nAnd so the social consequences of the second China shock around the world are likely to be as profound as the first in the West. We're starting to get a glimpse of what they might look like.\n\nA manufacturing hegemon\n\nMore than 300,000 people in Indonesia's garment factories and textile mills have lost their jobs to Chinese imports over the past two years, by one estimate.\n\nThat's when cheaper Chinese-made clothes and fabrics began streaming into the country. When one garment factory, in the city of Solo, shut down suddenly in March, 10,000 people were out of a job almost overnight.\n\nLocal businesses in Thailand have also been hurt. The central bank recently warned about the \"flooding of Chinese exports\" into Thailand and Southeast Asia, saying that the pressure had \"become more severe due to China's manufacturing overcapacity.\"\n\nIn Africa, imports from China hit $60 billion in September, already surpassing the figure for the full year in 2024.\n\nOfficial data released on Monday showed what insiders already knew: China this year has already run an annual trade surplus with the world exceeding $1 trillion for the first time.\n\n\"China's exports have been growing three times faster than global trade,\" said Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. That kind of growth can't happen without factories elsewhere closing down, he said.\n\nThis time around, China isn't exporting just cheap goods. It's also exporting the factories themselves, largely to get around Trump's tariffs, which are particularly high on products made in China.\n\nThis part has had its upsides for local economies. It's largely worked out well so far in Vietnam, in part because many of the industries that moved, like footwear and furniture, are labor intensive and need local workers.\n\nBut Malaysia is a case study in the perils of letting Chinese manufacturing become too dominant. Malaysia's fledging local solar industry was displaced by Chinese companies that built huge factories, employing tens of thousands of people.\n\nThen the United States set up tariffs taking direct aim at Chinese solar exports coming via Southeast Asia. The Chinese companies were mothballed, and today, Malaysia's solar industry is in ruins.\n\nUnemployment and unrest\n\nMany of the countries where China is sending more of its exports are going through a steep slowdown in domestic manufacturing.\n\nThey also have populations that skew young.\n\nThese dynamics may already be contributing to tension that has bubbled up in places like Indonesia, where young protesters have expressed frustration over a lack of opportunities.\n\n\"There is definitely a risk that if Chinese exports keep flooding in, you might see more and more protests,\" Priyanka Kishore, an economist in Singapore, said.\n\nThis makes for a volatile combination with the anti-Chinese sentiment that lurks in Southeast Asia, where businesses run by ethnic Chinese hold much of the wealth. Thousands of angry workers burned foreign-owned factories in Vietnam in 2014 in anger over China's attempts to control the South China Sea. In Indonesia, anti-Chinese riots broke out during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.\n\nMore than two decades ago, the West welcomed the efficiency of China's manufacturing machine, whose cheap labor enriched its businesses for years. It's been grappling with the social and political repercussions ever since.\n\nThere's a lesson there for countries in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Unlike the West, the countries bearing the brunt of the second China shock may not have asked for this. But they're going to need to brace for impact anyway.\n\nMORE TOP NEWS\n\nHamas 'still standing' in Gaza\n\nSince Israeli forces withdrew from parts of Gaza in October under a cease-fire deal, Hamas has moved quickly, sending its police forces out on the streets again.\n\nHamas now controls less than half of the territory in Gaza, with the rest occupied by Israel.

      "body": "BEIJING -- China got the world's attention in January when it announced that its trade surplus for goods and services had hit almost $1 trillion, an excess of exports to imports that no country had ever reached.\n\nNow China has surged through that milestone in just 11 months this year. China's customs agency announced Monday that the country's accumulated trade surplus reached $1.08 trillion through November.\n\nTariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on China have caused Chinese exports to the United States to drop by nearly a fifth. But China has throttled back its purchases of American soybeans and other products by almost the same rate, continuing to sell three times as much to the United States as it buys.\n\nChina's $111.68 billion trade surplus in November was its third-largest in a single month. The overall surplus through the first 11 months of the year is up 21.7% from the same period last year.\n\nChina has ramped up considerably its sales to other countries. From cars to solar panels to consumer electronics, a tsunami of Chinese exports is flooding Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. Carmakers and other exporters in traditional manufacturing powerhouses like Germany, Japan and South Korea are losing customers to Chinese rivals. Factories in developing countries like Indonesia and South Africa have had to curtail production or even close as they struggle to match China's low prices.\n\nChinese companies have shifted final assembly of their goods to Southeast Asia, Mexico and Africa, which then ship finished products to the United States. This has allowed them to partly bypass Trump's tariffs on goods coming straight from China.\n\nChina now sells more than twice as much to the European Union as it buys. China's trade surplus with the region has widened considerably this year.\n\nOne major reason is that China's currency has been weak over the past several years against many other currencies, particularly the euro. Another is that prices have been falling in China, while they have been rising in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe weakness of the Chinese currency, the yuan (also known as renminbi), has helped propel its exports. More than a tenth of the Chinese economy now consists of its trade surplus in manufactured goods. Europe has felt the sting sharply.\n\n\"With the renminbi undervalued by 30% against the euro, possibly more, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to compete against Chinese manufacturers even if Europe does all the right things it needs to do in terms of deregulation, bringing down energy prices and establishing a true unified market,\" said Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nChina's trade surplus in factory goods is even bigger as a share of its economy than the United States ran in the years immediately after World War II, when most other manufacturing nations were in ruins; or during the early years of World War I, when the United States was at peace and churning out civilian goods while Europe was embroiled in war.\n\nTop leaders of the International Monetary Fund, which monitors economies with the aim of preventing crises, are making their annual visit to China this week to review its currency and financial policies and are expected to announce a preliminary summary of their findings Wednesday.\n\nA growing number of economists and business leaders, including former senior officials at China's own central bank, are calling on Beijing to let the yuan increase in value against the dollar and other currencies.\n\nFor China, a stronger yuan would make goods like gasoline, French wines or Japanese cosmetics cheaper to import. Savings on such purchases would leave China's households with more money to spend on Chinese goods and services, like restaurant meals, concert tickets and electric cars.\n\nReviving consumer spending in China is one of the top goals of Beijing leaders. But doing so by allowing the yuan to strengthen would also carry costs for China.\n\nA stronger yuan would hurt China's exporters. The dollars they earn by selling goods in foreign markets would yield fewer yuan for them to pay workers and other expenses. Factories create millions of jobs in China, and a stronger yuan could slow the rate at which other countries transfer manufacturing to China.\n\nChina's export success has also financed a boom in technological innovation and has given Beijing the resources to help other authoritarian countries when they encounter difficulties, notably Russia, North Korea and Iran.\n\nChina is trying to preserve its trade surplus by pressing other countries not to erect trade barriers. \"Protectionism cannot solve the problems caused by global industrial restructuring, but will only worsen the international environment for trade,\" Xi Jinping, China's top leader, said Thursday, according to a Chinese government summary of his meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France.\n\nSome Chinese economists nonetheless say that China must someday accept a narrower trade surplus to help its long-suffering consumers.\n\n\"For China to expand domestic demand, it is necessary to minimize the trade surplus, and in the future it may even need to consider maintaining a trade deficit,\" Zhang Jun, dean of the School of Economics at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in a speech last month.",

It was an even larger drop than the 25% decline recorded in October.\n\nImports from America fell 19% in November compared to the previous year.\n\nBut \"China continues to rely less on selling stuff to the US,\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at One Point BFG Wealth Partners, wrote in a note Monday.\n\n\"China has a massive pool of domestic savings and China will again try to encourage consumers to unleash more of it to lessen their dependency on manufacturing and exports.\"\n\nOverall Chinese exports jumped 5.9% in November on a yearly basis - even higher than estimates and a rebound from an unexpected 1.1% drop in October.\n\nImports ticked up 1.9%, missing estimates of a 3% rise as a housing slump and job insecurity continue to pummel consumer spending in the nation.\n\nThe nation made up for its decline in US exports with a notable jump in shipments to other parts of the world - likely to be a major concern in the European Union, where exports jumped nearly 15% so far this year.\n\nChina's exports to Southeast Asia also rose more than 8% in the same period, a sign of the nation's \"transshipments\" - sending goods to other Asian countries like Vietnam before ultimately shipping them to America.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States' trade deficit has contracted sharply, plunging to $59.6 billion in August - down from $78.2 billion in July and $71.2 billion the previous year.\n\nAmerican exports and imports each hit new records in August at $62.4 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.\n\nSo far this year, the trade deficit with China is $185.2 billion - down roughly 21% from the previous year.\n\nPresident Trump has said he would likely travel to Beijing in April, while Chinese leader Xi Jinping has appeared willing to travel to the US early next year as both sides hope to nail down a more permanent trade deal.",

      "body": "China's exports topped forecasts in November, driven by a surge in shipments to non-US markets as manufacturers deepen trade ties with the rest of the world in light of President Donald Trump's prohibitively high tariffs.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy has ramped up efforts to diversify its export markets since Trump won last November's presidential election, pursuing closer trade ties with Southeast Asia and the European Union, and leveraging Chinese firms' global footprint to establish new production hubs for low-tariff access.\n\nChina's exports grew 5.9 percent year-on-year, customs data showed on Monday, reversing from a 1.1 percent contraction a month prior, and beating a 3.8 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nImports were up 1.9 percent, compared to a 1.0 percent uptick in October. Economists had expected a 3.0 percent increase.\n\n\"The tariff cuts agreed under the U.S.-China trade truce didn't help to lift shipments to the US last month, but overall export growth rebounded nonetheless,\" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. \"We expect China's exports will remain resilient, with the country continuing to gain global market share next year.\"\n\n\"The role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from US tariffs still appears to be increasing,\" she added.\n\nThe average US tariff on Chinese goods stands at 47.5 percent, well above the 40 percent threshold that economists say erodes Chinese exporters' profit margins.\n\nChinese shipments to the US dropped 29 percent in November year-on-year, the data shows, even though the month began with news that the United States and China had agreed to scale back some of their tariffs and a raft of other measures after Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea on October 30.\n\nExports to the European Union grew an annual 14.8 percent last month, while shipments to Australia surged 35.8 percent, and the fast-growing Southeast Asian economies took in 8.2 percent more goods over the same period.\n\nThat boosted China's trade surplus to $111.68 billion in November, the highest since June, from $90.07 billion recorded the previous month, and above a forecast of $100.2 billion. The trade surplus for the 11 months of the year topped $1 trillion for the first time.\n\n\"Electronic machinery and semiconductors seem to be key,\" said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group. \"There is a shortage in lower-grade chips and other electronics, which meant prices jumped, and Chinese companies going global have been importing all kinds of machinery and other inputs from China.\"\n\nKEY MEETINGS EYED AMID US-CHINA TRADE UNCERTAINTY\n\nChina's yuan firmed on Monday, off the back of the stronger-than-expected export data, with investors also awaiting policy signals from key year-end meetings.\n\nThe Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged on Monday to take steps to expand domestic demand, a shift analysts say is crucial for weaning the $19 trillion economy away from reliance on exports.\n\nTop officials are also expected to convene for the annual Central Economic Work Conference in the coming days to set key targets and outline policy priorities for next year.\n\nEconomists estimate that diminished access to the US market since Trump returned to the White House has reduced China's export growth by roughly 2 percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3 percent of GDP.\n\nOctober's unexpected downturn, following an 8.3 percent surge the month prior, signalled that Chinese exporters' tactic of front-loading US-bound shipments to beat Trump's tariffs had run its course.\n\nAlthough Chinese factory owners reported an improvement in new export orders in November, they were still in contraction, underscoring continued uncertainty for manufacturers as they struggle to replace demand in the absence of US buyers.\n\nAn official survey tracking broader factory activity showed that the sector contracted for an eighth consecutive month.\n\nDOMESTIC DEMAND STILL SOFT\n\nChina's rare earth exports jumped 26.5 percent month-on-month in November, the first full month after Xi and Trump agreed to speed up shipment of the critical minerals from the world's largest refiner.\n\nThe nation's soybean imports are also poised for their best-ever year, as Chinese buyers, who had shunned U.S. purchases for the majority of this year, stepped up purchases from American growers in addition to large purchases from Latin America.\n\nOverall, China's domestic demand remains soft due to a prolonged property downturn.\n\nThat weakness was seen in a decline in imports of unwrought copper, a key material in construction and manufacturing.\n\n\"China's pivot to establishing domestic demand as a key driver of growth will take time, but it's essential for China to move into the next phase in its economic development,\" said Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China.",

      "title": "China's Export Defies Trump Tariffs, Posting a 5.9% YoY Growth - Tekedia",
      "body": "China's exports posted a robust and unexpected surge in November, driven by manufacturers successfully deepening trade ties with the rest of the world to counter the severe headwinds created by President Donald Trump's prohibitively high tariffs.\n\nThe customs data, released Monday, confirms that the world's second-largest economy is executing a major strategic pivot to diversify its export markets and utilize its global supply chain footprint.\n\nChina's exports grew a significant 5.9% year-on-year, sharply reversing the 1.1% contraction recorded in October, and sailing past the 3.8% growth forecast in a Reuters poll. This performance is a direct result of trade rerouting -- a tactic where Chinese firms leverage their global manufacturing capacity to establish new, low-tariff production hubs in countries like Vietnam, Mexico, and Indonesia, effectively using third countries as processing and shipment intermediaries.\n\nThis practice is successfully offsetting the drag from US tariffs, which currently average 47.5% on Chinese goods, well above the 40% threshold that economists say erodes exporter profit margins.\n\nThe key takeaway from the data is the stark divergence between the US market and the rest of the world. Despite news of a tentative US-China trade truce and agreed-upon tariff scale-backs following the October 30 meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea, Chinese shipments to the US plummeted a massive 29% in November year-on-year.\n\nThis sustained collapse underscores the immediate and punitive impact of the current tariff regime. Economists estimate that diminished access to the U.S. market since Trump's return to the White House has already reduced China's export growth by roughly 2 percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3% of GDP.\n\nThe shortfall was more than compensated for by strong demand from new partners. Exports to the European Union grew by an annual 14.8%, shipments to Australia surged 35.8%, and fast-growing Southeast Asian economies took in 8.2% more goods over the same period. Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, noted that the agreed-upon tariff cuts failed to lift US-bound shipments, but \"overall export growth rebounded nonetheless,\" adding that \"The role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from U.S. tariffs still appears to be increasing.\"\n\nThe strong outbound performance boosted China's trade surplus to $111.68 billion in November -- the highest since June -- and the trade surplus for the first 11 months of the year topped $1 trillion for the first time ever.\n\n\"Electronic machinery and semiconductors seem to be key,\" said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group.\n\nShe noted a shortage in lower-grade chips and other electronics, which caused prices to jump, while Chinese companies going global have been importing various machinery and inputs from China itself. In a sign of a slight easing of trade tensions, rare earth exports jumped 26.5% month-on-month in November, the first full month after Xi and Trump agreed to speed up shipment of the critical minerals. Furthermore, the nation's soybean imports are poised for their best-ever year as Chinese buyers stepped up purchases from American growers alongside large purchases from Latin America.\n\nThe import figures indicated continued weakness in China's domestic economy. Imports were up 1.9% in November, compared to a 1.0% uptick in October, but still fell short of the 3.0% increase expected by economists. This suggests that domestic demand remains soft due to a prolonged property downturn, evidenced by a decline in imports of unwrought copper, a key material in construction.\n\nThe strong export data helped the Chinese yuan firm on Monday, with the spot yuan trading at 7.07 per dollar. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate at 7.0764 per dollar, using the daily fixing to act as a stabilizer for the currency.\n\nMeanwhile, policy signals are expected from key year-end meetings as officials look to manage the economic shift. The Politburo pledged on Monday to take steps to expand domestic demand -- a move analysts consider crucial for weaning the $19 trillion economy away from reliance on exports.\n\nOfficials are also convening for the annual Central Economic Work Conference to set key targets for the next year. Goldman Sachs analysts expect policymakers to emphasize easing measures aimed at boosting domestic consumption.\n\nLynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China, concluded that China's pivot to establishing domestic demand as a key driver of growth \"will take time, but it's essential for China to move into the next phase in its economic development.\"",

      "body": "China appeared largely unfazed by the Trump administration's tariff regime, posting a record annual trade surplus of more than $1 trillion as of November.\n\nAccording to new customs data released Monday, China's exports climbed 5.9% from a year earlier to $330.3 billion, following a 1.1% drop in October, the Associated Press reported. Over the first 11 months of the year, China's total trade surplus grew 22.1%, reaching roughly $1.08 trillion, already surpassing last year's full-year surplus of $992 billion.\n\nThe widening trade gap comes even as exports to the U.S. continue to crater. Shipments to the U.S. dropped nearly 29% compared to 2024, marking the eighth straight month of declines.\n\nThe numbers also come on the heels of a year-long trade truce reached in late October between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a meeting in South Korea. Under the agreement, the U.S. reduced some tariffs on Chinese goods, while Beijing pledged to lift its export restrictions on rare earth minerals and resume imports of American soybeans.\n\nPlease make a small donation to the Tampa Free Press to help sustain independent journalism.

      "body": "The overall surplus through the first 11 months of the year is up 21.7 percent from the same period last year\n\nChina got the world's attention last January when it announced that its trade surplus for goods and services had hit almost $1 trillion, an excess of exports to imports that no country had ever reached. Now China has surged through that milestone in just 11 months this year. China's customs agency announced on Monday that the country's accumulated trade surplus reached $1.08 trillion through November.\n\nTariffs imposed by US President Trump on China have caused Chinese exports to the US to drop by nearly a fifth. But China has throttled back its purchases of American soybeans and other products by almost the same rate, continuing to sell three times as much to the US as it buys.\n\nChina's $111.68 billion trade surplus in November was its third-largest ever in a single month. The overall surplus through the first 11 months of the year is up 21.7 percent from the same period last year.\n\nAlso Read\n\nExercise discretion while travelling through China: India to its nationals\n\nChina's 5,600 m mining leap: Inside the world's highest unmanned site\n\nChina's trade surplus hits record high, crosses $1 trn for first time\n\nChina's exports grow 5.9% in November despite 29% drop in US shipments\n\nTaiwan records 4 Chinese aircraft sorties, 7 vessels around territory\n\nChina has ramped up considerably its sales to other countries. From cars to solar panels to consumer electronics, a tsunami of Chinese exports is flooding Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. Carmakers and other exporters in traditional manufacturing powerhouses like Germany, Japan and South Korea are losing customers to Chinese rivals.\n\nChinese companies have shifted final assembly of their goods to Southeast Asia, Mexico and Africa, which then ship finished products to the US. This has allowed them to partly bypass Trump's tariffs on goods coming straight from China.\n\nChina now sells more than twice as much to the European Union as it buys. China's trade surplus with the region has widened considerably this year. One major reason is that China's currency has been weak over the last several years against many other currencies, particularly the euro. Another is that prices have been falling in China, while they have been rising in the US and Europe. The weakness of the\n\nChinese currency, the renminbi, has helped propel its exports.\n\n\"With the renminbi undervalued by 30 percent against the euro, possibly more, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to compete against Chinese manufacturers even if Europe does all the right things it needs to do in terms of deregulation, bringing down energy prices and establishing a true unified market,\" said Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nChina's trade surplus in factory goods is even bigger as a share of its economy than the US ran in the years immediately after World War II, when most other manufacturing nations were in ruins; or during the early years of World War I, when the US was at peace and churning out civilian goods while Europe was embroiled in war.\n\nTop leaders of the International Monetary Fund are making their annual visit to China this week to review its currency and financial policies and are expected to announce a preliminary summary of their findings on Wednesday. A growing number of economists and business leaders, including former senior officials at China's own central bank, are calling on Beijing to let the renminbi increase in value against the dollar and other currencies.\n\nFor China, a stronger renminbi would make goods like gasoline, French wines or Japanese cosmetics cheaper to import. Savings on such purchases would leave China's households with more money to spend on Chinese goods and services.\n\n\u00a92025 The New York Times News Service\n\nMore From This Section\n\nFrom Nobel to Grammy winners: People who defined excellence in 2025\n\nAfter jewel heist, Louvre faces fresh blow as water leak damages 400 works\n\nWhy ByteDance's AI phone is getting blocked by China's biggest apps\n\nAs tensions flare on Israel-Lebanon border, communities struggle to rebuild\n\nUN aid agency cuts appeal for 2026 to $33 bn after lowest annual support",

      "title": "Despite Trump tariffs, China's global trade surplus tops $1 trillion",
      "body": "Download PDF\n\nChina's annual trade surplus topped $1 trillion for the first time, a sign that President Donald Trump's high tariffs have done little to stop Chinese factories from flooding global markets with cars, electronics, machinery and other manufactured goods.\n\nThe unbalanced global economy that the president set out to change earlier this year remains deeply distorted.\n\nChina has responded to the highest U.S. tariffs since the 1930s by redirecting its factory output from American ports to Europe and Southeast Asia. While trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have eased in recent months, a backlash against Chinese manufactured goods is brewing in Europe.\n\nSeven years after Trump began imposing tariffs on Chinese goods during his first term to force an overhaul of China's economic model, the government in Beijing continues to subsidize manufacturing at the expense of Chinese consumers. The result is a structural tilt toward higher Chinese exports and comparatively anemic imports that is raising the chances of a confrontation between China and a growing number of its trading partners.\n\nChina's perennial trade surplus is mirrored by a deficit in the United States. Though Trump's tariffs have reduced total trade between the two nations, China continues to ship to American customers roughly three times as much as it buys from them, according to Census Bureau data.\n\nIn April, the president declared a national emergency over the trade deficit that the U.S. has run every year since 1975. He has blamed \"unfair trading practices\" on the part of other nations as well as domestic economic policies that discourage consumption for the U.S. trade deficit.\n\n\"This status quo of large and persistent imbalances is not sustainable,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an April speech.\n\nChina's General Administration of Customs said Monday that for the first 11 months of the year, exports increased by 5.4 percent compared with the same period last year, while imports fell slightly. That meant China ran a global trade surplus of $1.07 trillion, exceeding the $990 billion surplus recorded for the whole of 2024.\n\n\"Put simply, China's price competitiveness is extremely strong,\" said Xu Tianchen, a senior economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing. \"The main reason behind the continued growth of China's exports ... is not ... because the overall size of global trade has expanded, but because China is claiming a larger share of the existing trade landscape.\"\n\nExports to the U.S. fell 28 percent in November compared to the same month last year, an even greater decline than the 25 percent annual drop recorded in October, according to the official data.Ask The Post AIDive deeper\n\nThis comes after an October meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when a trade truce negotiated between the two sides earlier in the year was extended. Trump cut tariffs on imports from China and Xi agreed to resume purchasing soybeans and to delay restrictions on rare earth minerals for a year.\n\nXi signaled a willingness to travel to the U.S. early next year, and Trump has said he would likely travel to Beijing in April. Both sides aim to have a permanent trade agreement ready by then, analysts said.\n\nXi went into the October meeting feeling confident, analysts said, because Trump's tariff onslaught had not caused much damage to export-dependent China, even as its domestic economy was ailing. The latest data shows this trend is continuing, despite a blip in October.\n\nThat is partly because China appears to be \"transshipping\" more goods through Southeast Asia, despite the Trump administration's attempts to crack down on the practice.\n\nMonday's figures showed an 8 percent annual jump in the first 11 months of the year in Chinese exports to Southeast Asia, where Chinese-made goods can be assembled and shipped on to the U.S. market.\n\nChina's exports to Southeast Asia have grown strongly, Xu said. \"A large part of that is likely products that were ultimately destined for the U.S., but now make a stop in Southeast Asia.\"\n\nIt was also notable that the decline in U.S. exports was made up by a surge in China's exports to the rest of the world.\n\nThat will be of particular concern in the European Union, where Chinese exports rose at an annual rate of 14.8 percent in November.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, returning from a state visit to China, threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing did not take action to reduce its enormous trade surplus with the E.U.\n\n\"I told them that if they don't react, we Europeans will be forced to take strong measures in the coming months,\" Macron told Les Echos, the French business newspaper, in an interview published Sunday. Tariffs could be modeled after those imposed by the United States, he said.\n\nGermany, whose auto industry accounts for roughly 5 percent of economic output, is threatened by the swift emergence of Chinese automakers. China's global car exports soared by 53 percent in November, up from an already extraordinary 34 percent rise in October.\n\n- - -\n\nRudy Lu contributed to this report.",

Local manufacturers are already struggling with weaker demand and higher costs - and now, they need to contend with increasing competition from cheaper Chinese products.\n\n\u25b6 In fact, French leadership has said tougher trade measures - including tariffs of their own - might be needed to protect the domestic economy.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f If Europe pulls back, the very markets cushioning China's economy could become new sources of pain.\n\nThe bigger picture: China can't count on its friends forever.\n\nChina wants to rely less on trade and build a more balanced, resilient economy. But for now, exports are still doing the heavy lifting: they accounted for roughly a third of the country's economic growth this year. Meanwhile, China's domestic consumers are keeping their purse strings tight and the property market is still sluggish, with government pushes failing to create any real economic traction.",

      "body": "HONG KONG -- China's exports rebounded in November after an unexpected contraction the previous month, pushing its trade surplus past $1 trillion for the first time, according to data released Monday.\n\nExports climbed 5.9% from a year earlier in November while imports rose just under 2%.\n\nThe customs data released on Monday also showed that shipments to the U.S. dropped nearly 29% year-on-year. But as trade with the U.S. weakens, China is diversifying its export markets throughout Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America.\n\nChina's exports had contracted just over 1% in October. November's worldwide exports of $330.3 billion exceeded economists' estimates. Imports totaled $218.6 billion for the month.\n\nThe nearly $1.08 trillion trade surplus for the first 11 months of this year is a record high, surpassing the $992 billion surplus for all of 2024, based on official data compiled by FactSet.\n\nA year-long trade truce between China and the U.S. was reached at a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in late October in South Korea.

It also highlighted the need to boost domestic consumption, which could help address trade imbalances.\n\nA meeting of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's decision-making Politburo was held on Monday, led by Xi, to discuss economic plans for 2026, according to the Xinhua state news agency. It said Chinese leaders reiterated a focus on \"pursuing progress while ensuring stability.\"\n\nA readout from Xinhua said China needs to better coordinate its domestic economic work in the face of global \"trade struggles.\"\n\nBusinesses and investors are paying close attention to China's annual Central Economic Work Conference, which is expected to take place later this month and could map out economic priorities for the next year in more details.\n\n\"Trade diversification will remain a long-term strategy for China to fight the trade war and manage external exigencies,\" said Chi Lo, Global Market Strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management.\n\nA stable global trade environment is unlikely to last long, as China-U.S. relations \"remain in a stalemate\" despite their temporary trade truce, he said.\n\nStill, some economists believe that China will continue to gain export market share in coming years.\n\nMorgan Stanley predicts by 2030, China's market share in global exports will reach 16.5%, up from about 15% currently, fueled by its edge in advanced manufacturing and high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics and batteries.\n\n\"Despite persistent trade tensions, continued protectionism, and G20 economies taking up active industrial policies, we believe China will gain more share in the global goods export market,\" Morgan Stanley Chief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya said in a recent note.",

      "body": "Exports from China returned to growth in November, giving Beijing breathing room as it navigates an economic recovery and a complicated relationship with Washington.\n\nNovember customs data showed overseas shipments rising 5.9% from a year earlier to $330.3 billion, reversing October's contraction. The rebound pushed the trade surplus for the first eleven months to nearly $1.08 trillion, already above the full-year 2024 level. Imports also picked up, gaining 1.9% to more than $218.6 billion, even though the long slump in the property sector continues to weigh on confidence at home.\n\nChina's exporters are shipping less to the United States, where orders have fallen sharply for much of the year, including a drop of nearly 29% in November. However, they have found growth in other regions, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and the European Union, helping to sustain overall volumes.\n\nA trade truce agreed in South Korea by US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has eased some pressure. The United States has lowered tariffs, while Beijing has pledged to halt export controls on rare earths. \"It's likely that November exports have yet to fully reflect the tariff cut, which should feed through in the coming months,\" ING Bank chief economist for Greater China Lynn Song wrote in a report.\n\nThe external picture remains mixed. Official surveys show factory activity contracting for an eighth straight month, and economists warn that it is too early to call a clear turnaround in global demand. Chinese leaders still say growth of around 5% is within reach and have doubled down on advanced manufacturing over the next five years, in sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics and batteries.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects China to keep gaining share in world trade. \"Despite persistent trade tensions, continued protectionism, and G20 economies taking up active industrial policies, we believe China will gain more share in the global goods export market,\" Morgan Stanley Chief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya said in a recent note.",

      "title": "China brushes off Trump tariffs with jaw-dropping $1 trillion surplus",
      "body": "China appeared largely unfazed by the Trump administration's tariff regime, posting a record annual trade surplus of more than $1 trillion as of November.\n\nAccording to new customs data released Monday, China's exports climbed 5.9% from a year earlier to $330.3 billion, following a 1.1% drop in October, the Associated Press reported. Over the first 11 months of the year, China's total trade surplus grew 22.1%, reaching roughly $1.08 trillion, already surpassing last year's full-year surplus of $992 billion.\n\nThe widening trade gap comes even as exports to the U.S. continue to crater.

      "title": "GT Voice: Trade data point to potential for deeper co-op between China, SK",
      "body": "Illustration: Chen Xia/GTData from South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources showed that the country's exports reached $640.2 billion in the first 11 months of this year, a year-on-year increase of 2.9 percent and the highest level for the period since 2022, according to a Yonhap News Agency report on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese customs figures revealed on Monday that China's imports from South Korea during the same period grew by 3.2 percent year-on-year.\n\nAs South Korea's largest overseas market, China plays a significant role in sustaining its export growth. The steady expansion of China's imports aligns closely with the overall rise in South Korea's exports, illustrating the deeply interconnected nature of bilateral trade.\n\nThis linkage is particularly evident in key industries. For instance, the semiconductor sector, which serves as a pillar of the South Korean economy, accounts for more than 20 percent of its total exports, with a big portion of those semiconductors destined for China, strongly supporting China's vast electronics manufacturing sector and consumer market.\n\nIn 2024, bilateral trade reached $328.08 billion, a year-on-year increase of 5.6 percent. China has remained South Korea's largest trading partner for 21 consecutive years, and South Korea has returned to being China's second-largest trading partner. As the global industrial chain faces restructuring pressures, such close trade exchanges not only reflect the resilience of the bilateral economic relationship but also indicate broad potential for further deepening cooperation.\n\nThere are indeed voices in South Korea expressing concerns about industrial competition with China. For instance, according to a report released on Sunday by a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute of Finance, Chinese export prices fell steadily from the second quarter of 2023 to September 2025, intensifying the competitive pressure on South Korean exporters across a range of sectors, according to Yonhap.\n\nThis trend largely reflects the ongoing adjustments in global manufacturing and China's industrial upgrading, but it won't change the strategic and mutually beneficial nature of the cooperation between the two sides.\n\nCompetition and cooperation often coexist. In the electronics industry, for example, South Korea's strengths in high-end chips and China's robust manufacturing capacity and market demand have created a relationship of deep complementarity and synergy. While China's industrial advancement introduces competitive dynamics, it also opens broader avenues for the application of South Korean technologies and products. Therefore, over-focusing on competitive threats may instead lead to neglecting the huge opportunities for industrial chain collaboration and joint market development.\n\nMoreover, jointly exploring the Asian market has emerged as a crucial pathway for China and South Korea to navigate global industrial chain restructuring and achieve mutual benefits. The continued expansion of intra-Asian trade underscores the region's strong internal economic momentum. Recent figures show that South Korea's exports to China and Southeast Asia have grown significantly, further confirming the importance of the Asian market.\n\nIn November, South Korea's exports to China increased by 6.9 percent year-on-year, and its exports to Southeast Asia rose by 6.3 percent, while exports to the EU fell by 1.9 percent, government data showed.\n\nWith the in-depth advancement of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and the growth opportunities brought by emerging fields such as the digital economy and green transformation, the scope for cooperation between China and South Korea will become increasingly broad.\n\nAmid uncertainties in the global economy, as important participants in the Asian and even global manufacturing and trade networks, efforts by China and South Korea to strengthen industrial chain synergy and jointly maintain regional economic stability will not only help deepen the integration and expansion of the two countries' markets but also inject important impetus into promoting sustained regional prosperity and global economic growth.",

New data from China's customs agency shows exports rose 5.4% to $3.4 trillion in the first 11 months of the year, while imports fell slightly to $2.3 trillion. That's good for a surplus of $1.08 trillion, the largest ever recorded anywhere and a sign of China's growing dominance in trade across a vast range of products.\n\n\"It is so big that it's obvious that it's not just the United States or Europe but the whole world that will have to fund that gap,\" says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. The milestone comes despite a trade war with the Trump administration that has resulted in high US tariffs -- currently averaging 37% -- on Chinese imports. But Beijing has compensated in part by shifting focus to markets in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America on everything from consumer electronics to automobiles, per the New York Times. It's also cut back on its imports of American soybeans and other products.\n\n\"China continues to rely less on selling stuff to the US,\" wrote Peter Boockvar of One Point BFG Wealth Partners, per CNBC. \"China has a massive pool of domestic savings, and China will again try to encourage consumers to unleash more of it to lessen their dependency on manufacturing and exports.\" The surplus is becoming a major point of tension globally, not just in the US, with officials in Europe warning of potential trade barriers if the imbalance continues. \"Concern is growing,\" says Eskelund. \"(We may) get to a point where things snap.\"",

      "title": "China's trillion dollar triumph amid Trump's tariff tantrum - The Times of India",
      "body": "TOI correspondent from Washington : Tariffs? What tariffs? In a resounding rebuff to US efforts to corral its manufacturing might and gargantuan growth, China announced a $ 1 trillion trade surplus with the world on Monday, leaving Washington, New Delhi, Brussels among others capitals wringing their hands. It is the first time in human history that any country has crossed the $ 1 trillion milestone - which means China exported more (approximately $3.6 trillion worth of goods) than it imported (about $ 2.6 trillion) - cementing its standing as a manufacturing superpower. The watershed moment came despite Trump's tariff tentacles as Chinese manufacturers slipped through the American grab, diversifying their markets, lessening dependence on the US, and demonstrating resilience in the face of headwinds, something India is struggling to do. Trade figures show exports from China to the US plunged nearly 29% year-on-year in November 2025, marking the eighth consecutive month of double-digit decline, but Beijing more than made up for it by cranking up exports to EU, South East Asia, India, and Africa. Also read: The trillion-dollar shock - What tariff? How Xi Jinping beat Trump in trade warIn November 2025 alone, Chinese exports rose by 5.9% year-on-year, while imports grew just 1.9%, generating a monthly surplus of roughly $111.7 billion -- one of the largest monthly surpluses China has ever logged.While the U.S whittled down Chinese imports to a degree, New Delhi, like much of the world, was at the receiving end of Beijing's export boom. India's imports from China in fiscal year 2024-25 surging to $113.45 billion, while its exports to China dwindled to just $14.25 billion - a staggering trade deficit of nearly $ 100 billion. It is the largest deficit New Delhi has ever had with any trading partner as Indians sucked up Chinese electronics, cell phones, toys, machinery, batteries, and solar cells, some of it vital to India's manufacturing and infrastructure sectors.Economists and policymakers were gobsmacked by the sheer scale of China's surplus, particularly in light of Trump tariffs. The $1.076 trillion figure in 2025 overshoots by far the previous record of $ 992 billion under more propitious circumstances in 2024, underlining how resilient and broad China's export engine has become -- even as trade tensions and tariffs persisted. In 2024, roughly one-third of China's total surplus -- about $360 billion -- came from trade with the US It ran up a similar surplus with the EU. In fact, there is no widely-reported country or bloc to which China runs a consistent large-scale trade deficit in goods. Instead, most major economies -- from the US and EU to India -- run substantial deficits with China.Much of China's growing trade surplus despite U.S tariffs came from rerouting shipments to other destinations. Chinese exports to the EU surged 15% from a year earlier. While exports to the US for November plunged 29% from a year earlier, Beijing posted an overall 5.9% increase in exports to rest of the world, with Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America accounting for 26%, 14% and 7.1% increase respectively.The widening imbalances risk reshaping global manufacturing geography, amid fears that China is not only dominating low-cost production, but also high-tech supply chains, locking in dependencies for years, as it demonstrated with its stranglehold on rare earths product supply. The $1 trillion-plus surplus also gives Beijing room to absorb domestic economic weakness -- notably weak consumption and a troubled property sector -- without relying on foreign debt or capital inflows like most other countries. Such has been the Chinese dominance that even U.S commentators expressed grudging admiration for its powerhouse push. \"China established itself as a maker of cheap wigs, sneakers and Christmas lights in the 1980s and 1990s, earning a moniker as the world's factory floor. But that was just the beginning... In recent years, its leading-edge companies have established themselves as dominant players in solar panels, electric vehicles and the semiconductors that power everyday household items,\" the Wall Street Journal acknowledged, noting that China is making itself an indispensable cog in global supply chains spanning technology, transport, medicine and consumer goods.Beijing itself was modesty personified as it broke new barriers. \"We want to be lowkey, but our capabilities is just too much,\" the country's office of foreign liaison posted on X. \"The Chinese century is being imposed upon us, we have no choice but to take the mantle of responsibility,\" it added.",

      "body": "Exports climbed 5.9% from a year earlier in November while imports rose just under 2%.\n\nThe customs data released on Monday also showed that shipments to the U.S. dropped nearly 29% year-on-year. But as trade with the U.S. weakens, China is diversifying its export markets throughout Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America.\n\nChina's exports had contracted just over 1% in October. November's worldwide exports of $330.3 billion exceeded economists' estimates. Imports totaled $218.6 billion for the month.\n\nThe nearly $1.08 trillion trade surplus for the first 11 months of this year is a record high, surpassing the $992 billion surplus for all of 2024, based on official data compiled by FactSet.\n\nA year-long trade truce between China and the U.S. was reached at a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in late October in South Korea. The U.S. has lowered its tariffs on China, and China has promised to halt its export controls related to rare earths.\n\n\"It's likely that November exports have yet to fully reflect the tariff cut, which should feed through in the coming months,\" ING Bank chief economist for Greater China Lynn Song wrote in a report.\n\nChina's factory activity contracted for an eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey, and economists said it was still early to determine whether there was a real rebound in external demand following the U.S.-China trade truce.\n\nWith exports still going strong, economists generally expect China to meet its target of around 5% annual growth for this year.\n\nChinese leaders outlined a focus on advanced manufacturing for the next five years following a high-level meeting in October. It also highlighted the need to boost domestic consumption, which could help address trade imbalances.\n\nA meeting of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's decision-making Politburo was held on Monday, led by Xi, to discuss economic plans for 2026, according to the Xinhua state news agency. It said Chinese leaders reiterated a focus on \"pursuing progress while ensuring stability.\"\n\nA readout from Xinhua said China needs to better coordinate its domestic economic work in the face of global \"trade struggles.\"\n\nBusinesses and investors are paying close attention to China's annual Central Economic Work Conference, which is expected to take place later this month and could map out economic priorities for the next year in more details.\n\n\"Trade diversification will remain a long-term strategy for China to fight the trade war and manage external exigencies,\" said Chi Lo, Global Market Strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management.\n\nA stable global trade environment is unlikely to last long, as China-U.S. relations \"remain in a stalemate\" despite their temporary trade truce, he said.\n\nStill, some economists believe that China will continue to gain export market share in coming years.\n\nMorgan Stanley predicts by 2030, China's market share in global exports will reach 16.5%, up from about 15% currently, fueled by its edge in advanced manufacturing and high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics and batteries.\n\n\"Despite persistent trade tensions, continued protectionism, and G20 economies taking up active industrial policies, we believe China will gain more share in the global goods export market,\" Morgan Stanley Chief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya said in a recent note.",

      "body": "Foreign trade will remain pivotal to China's economic performance in 2026, as policymakers and exporters prioritize industrial upgrade, high-standard opening-up and market diversification as key growth drivers, government officials and economists said on Monday.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the annual Central Economic Work Conference, they noted that as global demand stabilizes and China's export profile shifts further toward high-value and green products, its foreign trade sector remains well-positioned to propel economic growth, bolster supply chain security and advance the development of new quality productive forces.\n\nUsually convened in December to set the policy tone for the following year, the high-level meeting is closely watched by the international business community, as it outlines the country's annual macroeconomic priorities and major reform tasks.\n\nChina's foreign trade rose to 41.21 trillion yuan ($5.83 trillion) in the first 11 months of 2025, up 3.6 percent year-on-year, while its exports grew 6.2 percent on a yearly basis to 24.46 trillion yuan, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs on Monday.\n\nThe trend has reinforced expectations that China will further advance high-standard opening-up. Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao said that China will take further steps to expand its opening-up on its own initiative, aligning with high-standard international economic and trade rules while accommodating its own development needs.\n\nIn a signed article published on Monday in People's Daily, Wang said the government will promote innovation in trade, improve the quality and efficiency of foreign trade, and accelerate the country's transition toward becoming a strong trading nation.\n\nEfforts will focus on upgrading goods trade, expanding intermediate goods and green trade, advancing digital trade, and fostering new drivers of foreign trade growth. China will also work to diversify markets and better integrate domestic and foreign trade, he added.\n\nThe commerce minister's remarks came as China's latest trade data pointed to steady gains. Lyu Daliang, director of the GAC's department of statistics and analysis, said that as of November, China's trade in goods had posted year-on-year growth for 10 consecutive months, underscoring the continued resilience and dynamism of the country's foreign trade.\n\n\"China has upheld an approach of openness, cooperation and mutual benefit, while steadily expanding two-way trade with its partners,\" said Lyu, adding that the country recorded simultaneous growth in both exports and imports with more than 110 countries and regions in the first 11 months, an increase of over 20 compared with the same period last year.\n\nLouise Loo, head of Asia Economics at British think tank Oxford Economics, said that China's exports have remained resilient this year. This strength reflects the resilience gained from the country's ongoing shift in export structure -- from supplying consumer goods to Western markets to providing intermediate goods for emerging economies -- alongside the steady expansion of higher value-added product segments where Chinese manufacturers retain a cost advantage.\n\n\"These suggest Chinese inputs have been further embedded into global supply chains,\" said Loo. \"While a more tentative global demand environment may pull down goods exports, we expect they will stay as a relatively bright spot of the Chinese economy.\"\n\nRobin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, said that China will maintain its strong share in global exports, supported by its integrated and cost-effective supply chains and growing tech prowess.\n\n\"The demand from the United States will remain steady next year, particularly with investments in the booming artificial intelligence sector. That will not be bad news for the world and for China, and will support part of China's exports,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to boosting exports, China will continue opening its vast market to foreign companies and expanding imports, benefiting the global economy and sharing growth opportunities with international partners.\n\nWang, the minister, stressed in his article that China will continue to expand market access for foreign players, with the services sector's further opening being a key policy focus.\n\nThe government will study and advance new pilot programs to further open areas such as telecommunications and healthcare, promote the orderly expansion of self-initiated opening-up in services, and deepen the comprehensive pilot program for expanding opening-up in selected locations, he said.\n\nSeeking to benefit from China's opening-up measures and dynamic market environment, Swiss technology company ABB Group plans to invest more in its electrification business within the country over the next five years.\n\n\"China is a place where we must be present,\" said Sergio Silvestri, senior vice-president for smart power Asia of ABB Electrification, noting that China's open and rapidly evolving market, rich pool of skilled talent and highly integrated supply-chain ecosystem further reinforce its appeal as a destination for long-term investment, innovation and exports.\n\nThe company currently exports smart power products and solutions from its manufacturing bases in China to more than 70 countries and regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and South America, and plans to expand its export footprint to additional markets in the coming years.",

      "body": "BEIJING, Dec 8 (Reuters) - China's exports topped forecasts in November, driven by a surge in shipments to non-U.S. markets as manufacturers deepen trade ties with the rest of the world in light of President Donald Trump's prohibitively high tariffs.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy has ramped up efforts to diversify its export markets since Trump won last November's presidential election, pursuing closer trade ties with Southeast Asia and the European Union, and leveraging Chinese firms' global footprint to establish new production hubs for low-tariff access.\n\nChina's exports grew 5.9% year-on-year, customs data showed on Monday, reversing from a 1.1% contraction a month prior, and beating a 3.8% forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nImports were up 1.9%, compared to a 1.0% uptick in October. Economists had expected a 3.0% increase.\n\n\"The tariff cuts agreed under the U.S.-China trade truce didn't help to lift shipments to the U.S. last month, but overall export growth rebounded nonetheless,\" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. \"We expect China's exports will remain resilient, with the country continuing to gain global market share next year.\"\n\n\"The role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from U.S. tariffs still appears to be increasing,\" she added.\n\nThe average U.S. tariff on Chinese goods stands at 47.5%, well above the 40% threshold that economists say erodes Chinese exporters' profit margins.\n\nChinese shipments to the U.S. dropped 29% in November year-on-year, the data shows, even though the month began with news that the United States and China had agreed to scale back some of their tariffs and a raft of other measures after Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea on October 30.\n\nExports to the European Union grew an annual 14.8% last month, while shipments to Australia surged 35.8%, and the fast-growing Southeast Asian economies took in 8.2% more goods over the same period.\n\nThat boosted China's trade surplus to $111.68 billion in November, the highest since June, from $90.07 billion recorded the previous month, and above a forecast of $100.2 billion.\n\nThe trade surplus for the 11 months of the year topped $1 trillion for the first time.\n\n\"Electronic machinery and semiconductors seem to be key,\" said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group. \"There is a shortage in lower-grade chips and other electronics, which meant prices jumped, and Chinese companies going global have been importing all kinds of machinery and other inputs from China.\"\n\nKEY MEETINGS EYED AMID US-CHINA TRADE UNCERTAINTY\n\nCranes and cargo ships at a terminal of the Yantian port in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China October 30, 2025.

      "title": "China's Export Recovery Driven by Strong Non-US Demand as Trade Patterns S",
      "body": "China's exports exceeded expectations in November, buoyed by rising demand from markets beyond the United States as Chinese manufacturers consolidate trade partnerships across the Global South and Europe. According to official customs data released on Monday, outbound shipments from the world's second largest economy increased by 5.9 percent year on year, reversing a 1.1 percent contraction in October and outperforming economists' forecasts of a 3.8 percent rise.\n\nImports also edged higher by 1.9 percent compared to a 1.0 percent increase in the previous month, although analysts had anticipated a stronger rebound of 3.0 percent. The trade surplus widened significantly to 111.68 billion dollars in November, up from 90.07 billion dollars in October and above market expectations of around 100.2 billion dollars.\n\nXu Tianchen, a senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, observed that the growth was largely driven by exports to the European Union, Africa and Latin America. \"There has been no notable improvement in China's direct exports to the United States. The expansion has been largely supported by stronger trade flows to emerging and non-US markets,\" he explained.\n\nShipments to the United States fell by 29 percent year on year in November, despite a tentative agreement in late October between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping to ease some tariffs and restore partial trade cooperation. Economists estimate that reduced access to the US market has trimmed China's overall export growth by approximately two percentage points, equating to a 0.3 percent drag on national GDP.\n\nThe resurgence in November followed a period of volatility in Chinese trade data, with exporters previously accelerating shipments to the United States to avoid higher tariffs. However, this front-loading strategy appeared to have reached its limit by October, reflecting the continuing challenges Chinese manufacturers face in reorienting supply chains away from American demand.\n\nDespite some improvement in new export orders, the broader manufacturing sector remained in contraction for the eighth consecutive month, according to an official survey tracking industrial activity. Persistent uncertainty around global demand and trade policy continues to weigh on China's manufacturing confidence.\n\nFor African economies, this shift in China's export strategy presents both opportunities and cautionary lessons. The strengthening of trade relations with Africa and Latin America reflects a deeper recalibration of global economic linkages in which developing regions play a more significant role. However, it also underscores the importance of ensuring that Africa's trade relations with China evolve towards mutual benefit and sustainable industrial development rather than dependency on imported goods.\n\nAs China diversifies its export destinations and the United States maintains protectionist measures, Africa's growing consumer markets and expanding infrastructure investment programmes are becoming critical anchors for Beijing's global trade ambitions. This realignment may foster more balanced trade flows and increased opportunities for African producers and manufacturers seeking integration into global value chains.\n\nNevertheless, economists caution that China's recovery remains uneven, as the global economy faces persistent headwinds from inflationary pressures, shifting energy dynamics and monetary policy uncertainty. For now, China's November data signal resilience, but sustaining that momentum will depend on how effectively the world's manufacturing hub deepens partnerships with regions such as Africa and Latin America, which are increasingly pivotal in shaping the future of global trade.",

      "body": "European officials signaled possible tariff actions and broader trade curbs, posing risks to China's outlook as Beijing faces pressure to shift toward domestic demand.\n\nChina's annual trade surplus exceeded $1 trillion for the first time despite a deepening plunge in shipments to the U.S., risking a backlash from markets flooded by goods from the world's biggest manufacturing nation.\n\nExports returned to growth in November after an unexpected drop the previous month, rising 5.9% from a year earlier and far outpacing a 1.9% gain in imports, according to data published by China's General Administration of Customs on Dec. 8. The November surplus came in at $112 billion, the third largest ever accumulated by China in a single month and far more than forecast by economists.\n\nAs China navigated the trade war and growing economic protectionism around the world, the country amassed a surplus of $1.1 trillion, needing just 11 months to catapult it past a full-year record set in 2024. While shipments to the U.S. plummeted 29% in November -- the eighth month of double-digit declines and the biggest since August -- strong growth in sales to regions like the European Union and Africa more than offset the slump.\n\nThe display of export dominance is stirring waves of resentment abroad. French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited China last week, has warned the EU may take \"strong measures,\" including by imposing tariffs, should Beijing fail to address the imbalance.\n\n\"If the EU indeed does follow suit with tariffs, it would represent a significant risk to the external demand outlook for China,\" said Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING Bank NV.\n\nThe milestone reached by China follows the recent de-escalation of tensions with the Trump administration. The huge surplus also underscores how Beijing is struggling to rebalance the economy away from its dependence on demand abroad, with net exports accounting for almost a third of economic growth this year.\n\n\"It does look like China's export competitiveness is still standing firm against US tariffs,\" said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA, referring to robust shipments to other markets than America. Rising trade tensions with the EU are \"a source of downside risk to watch out for,\" she said.\n\nOn Monday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul arrived in China for a two-day trip, becoming the latest senior European official to visit for talks. China's exports to the EU expanded almost 15% last month -- the fastest since July 2022 -- with sales to France, Germany and Italy all seeing double-digit growth.\n\nWadephul said before the trip that he'd raise trade curbs, especially on rare earths, and \"overcapacities\" in electric vehicles and steel with his Chinese counterparts. China's auto imports are down almost 39% in the year to date.\n\nShipments overseas have boomed for much of this year, in spite of US President Donald Trump's launch of a trade war early in 2025. The world's second-biggest economy has emerged largely unscathed from the standoff, as it delivered more goods to markets other than the US.\n\nThe year-on-year increase in exports of electronic and machinery products rebounded to almost 10% last month, versus October's rise of just over 1%, according to Bloomberg calculations based on China's customs data. Declines in shipments of consumer goods narrowed.\n\nExports to Africa surged nearly 28% in November, while those to the Southeast Asian trading bloc gained only 8.4%, the least since February. Despite escalating tensions over the self-governing island of Taiwan, imports from Japan rose faster in November than exports to there, resulting in a $1.3 billion deficit for China.\n\nThe historic trade surplus will help boost growth in gross domestic product after months of deterioration in the economy. Retail sales are coming off their longest stretch of slowdowns since 2021 while investment just shrank by a record amount.\n\nAlthough the Chinese economy is expanding at a slower pace in the last quarter of the year, its strong performance earlier in 2025 means the official growth target of around 5% is likely within reach.\n\nForeign demand has been the one consistent driver of Chinese growth, helping compensate for lackluster private consumption at home and the prolonged slump in the housing market.\n\nBut the trade picture has become increasingly unbalanced, with China's weak demand and increasingly innovative firms slashing demand for imports.\n\nWhile it's \"ultimately essential\" for China to embrace a growth model driven more by domestic demand, such a pivot will take time, according to ING's Song.\n\n\"We need to see what sort of concrete measures are put into place to boost domestic consumption, and how those measures to increase win-win cooperation and establish international consumption centers play out,\" he said. \"It's quite clear at this point that relying on external demand as the main growth engine is a risky bet.\"",

      "title": "China's Trade Surplus Surpasses $1 Trillion Amidst Global Trade Shifts",
      "body": "China's trade surplus hit a record $1 trillion this year despite US tariffs and a global economic slowdown, driven by strong exports to Southeast Asia and strategic shifts. This increase comes even as exports to the US declined, and as China looks to build new growth drivers.\n\nChina 's trade surplus in goods has surged past $1 trillion this year, reaching a record $1.076 trillion in the first eleven months, according to the country's customs administration. This remarkable achievement, which considers goods but not services, comes despite the backdrop of a prolonged trade war with the United States and evolving global economic conditions.\n\nThe surge in the trade surplus underscores the robust performance of Chinese exports, driven by a combination of factors including resilient global demand, particularly in Southeast Asia, and strategic shifts in trade routes. Exports witnessed a 5.9% rise in November compared to the previous year, following an unexpected dip in October. While exports to the US have experienced a significant decline, shipments to other regions, especially Southeast Asia, have witnessed substantial growth, with an 8% increase last month. Economic analysts suggest that some of these shipments are subsequently trans-shipped to the US, effectively mitigating the impact of US tariffs. The depreciation of the renminbi against the euro and in line with the dollar has also contributed to the enhanced competitiveness of Chinese exports, further bolstering the trade surplus, particularly with the European Union. China's reliance on exports to fuel economic activity has become increasingly pronounced, especially amid weaker domestic demand and a persistent slowdown in the property sector, which has entered its fifth year. President Xi Jinping, during a Communist party politburo meeting focused on economic policy, emphasized the importance of boosting domestic consumption as the primary driver of growth while simultaneously fostering new growth engines, specifically industries like electric vehicles and robotics that are vital to China's export strength. Exports to the European Union also experienced a notable surge in November, with a 14.8% increase year-on-year, a significant rise compared to the 0.9% growth in October. \\Analysts predict continued export strength in the coming year, although they anticipate increasing resistance from trading partners. French President Emmanuel Macron has criticized the imbalances. Concerns regarding potential tariff increases from the European Union and a slightly slower global growth outlook pose uncertainties for future export demand. Despite these challenges, China is poised to increase its share of global exports. Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Chetan Ahya, forecast a rise from 15% now to 16.5% by 2030, believing that protectionist measures from trading partners are unlikely to halt this progress. China's dominant position in high-growth emerging sectors, such as electric vehicles, batteries, and robotics, is expected to further strengthen its position in global manufacturing and trade. According to Capital Economics, the role of trade rerouting in offsetting the impact of US tariffs is still growing, contributing to the expanding trade surplus expected in the coming year.

      "body": "China's export engine roared back to life in November, erasing the previous month's unexpected stumble and propelling the country's trade surplus past a historic milestone. The world's manufacturing powerhouse demonstrated remarkable resilience by diversifying its customer base even as one of its largest markets continues shrinking.\n\nExport figures jumped 5.9% compared to the same period last year, reaching $330.3 billion for the month. The performance exceeded analyst predictions and marked a sharp reversal from October's 1.1% decline. Import growth remained modest at just under 2%, totaling $218.6 billion.\n\nThe widening gap between what China sells abroad and what it buys from other countries tells a striking story. The nation's trade surplus for the first 11 months hit nearly $1.08 trillion, shattering the previous full year record of $992 billion set in 2024. No country has ever accumulated such a massive trade imbalance in a single calendar year.\n\nThe numbers reveal a dramatic geographical shift in China's export strategy. Shipments to the United States collapsed by nearly 29% compared to last year, marking the eighth consecutive month of double digit declines to America. Yet overall export volumes continued climbing as Chinese manufacturers successfully redirected their products elsewhere.\n\nSoutheast Asia, Latin America, Africa and the European Union absorbed much of the goods that once flowed to American ports. This geographic diversification reflects both necessity and strategy as trade tensions reshape global commerce patterns.\n\nA year long trade truce between Beijing and Washington, negotiated during an October meeting in South Korea between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, has started easing some pressure. The United States reduced tariffs on Chinese goods while China agreed to stop restricting rare earth exports.\n\nING Bank chief economist for Greater China Lynn Song suggests November's strong performance may not yet fully capture the benefits of reduced tariffs. Those effects should become more apparent in coming months as businesses adjust their planning and ordering patterns.\n\nFactory activity across China contracted for the eighth straight month in November according to official surveys, raising questions about whether external demand is genuinely recovering or if the export surge represents a temporary phenomenon. The persistent property sector downturn continues dampening consumer spending and business investment within China itself.\n\nDespite these domestic headwinds, economists generally predict China will achieve its approximately 5% annual growth target for 2025. Export strength provides crucial support even as internal economic engines sputter.\n\nChinese leadership doubled down on advanced manufacturing priorities during high level planning sessions. An annual economic meeting led by Xi on Monday outlined 2026 strategies emphasizing progress while maintaining stability. Officials acknowledged the need for better coordination of domestic economic policies given global trade struggles.\n\nBNP Paribas Asset Management strategist Chi Lo warns the current calm in US China trade relations likely won't endure. The fundamental relationship remains stuck despite temporary agreements, suggesting future turbulence ahead.\n\nYet some analysts see China's export machine gaining even more global market share. Morgan Stanley projects Chinese exports will capture 16.5% of worldwide trade by 2030, up from roughly 15% currently. The forecast hinges on China's advantages in cutting edge manufacturing sectors including electric vehicles, robotics and battery technology.\n\nMorgan Stanley Chief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya argues China will continue expanding its slice of global export markets despite ongoing trade tensions, rising protectionism and competing industrial policies from other major economies. The country's manufacturing capabilities and focus on high growth industries provide sustainable competitive advantages that transcend temporary political obstacles.\n\nThe record breaking trade surplus underscores how thoroughly China has embedded itself in global supply chains. Even with one major market pulling back sharply, the manufacturing colossus found eager buyers across multiple continents, demonstrating both the breadth of its production capabilities and the depth of worldwide demand for Chinese made goods.",

      "body": "US companies like Costco filed lawsuits for tariff refunds, betting the courts will overturn Trump's tariff policies\n\nChina's trade surplus reached a historic milestone in 2025, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time. The customs data released Monday shows Chinese exports climbed 5.9% in November to $330.3 billion while imports rose only 1.9% to $218.6 billion.\n\nThe nearly $1.08 trillion surplus for the first eleven months exceeds China's full-year 2024 total of $992 billion. The growing gap between exports and imports demonstrates China's continued dominance in global manufacturing.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule in coming weeks on President Trump's authority to impose tariffs. Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy blanket tariffs on imported goods from multiple countries.\n\nThe legal challenge questions whether the president can impose taxes without congressional approval. The Constitution grants Congress oversight of taxation and spending, not the executive branch.\n\nShipments from China to the United States dropped 29% year-over-year in November. This marks the eighth consecutive month of double-digit declines in US-China trade flows.\n\nChina is shifting its export strategy toward new markets. Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe are receiving increased shipments as US trade weakens.\n\nA trade truce between the US and China was struck in late October. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in South Korea to negotiate the agreement.\n\nUnder the deal, the US lowered some tariffs on Chinese goods. China agreed to stop export controls on rare earth materials in exchange.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed Wednesday that China is honoring the agreement. He told a New York Times summit that China is keeping \"every part of the deal.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley predicts China's share of global exports will reach 16.5% by 2030. The projection factors in China's advantages in electric vehicles, robotics, batteries and advanced manufacturing.\n\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told Politico that Trump is considering withdrawing from the USMCA. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement currently allows Canada and Mexico to export products with minimal tariffs if they meet origin requirements.\n\nAn exit from USMCA would reshape North American trade relationships. The agreement replaced NAFTA during Trump's first term in office.\n\nTrump has also ordered federal agencies to investigate food supply chain price fixing. The Department of Justice and Federal Commission will examine whether foreign companies are artificially inflating meat prices.\n\nSeveral American companies filed legal claims seeking tariff refunds. Costco is among the businesses challenging Trump's tariff authority in court.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules against Trump, the federal government may need to repay billions in collected tariff revenue. The New York Times reported this potential financial exposure based on pending litigation.\n\nTrump praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Wednesday for understanding chip export restrictions to China. \"He knows,\" Trump said about the limits on technology transfers.\n\nChinese factory activity contracted for the eighth straight month in November according to official surveys. Economists say China will likely still meet its 5% annual growth target for 2025 due to strong export performance.",

      "title": "China shrugs off Trump's tariffs with world-record $1 trillion trade surplus",
      "body": "China's export machine roared back to life last month, pushing its trade surplus for 2025 over the $1 trillion threshold for the first time on record.\n\nNot only is it a first for China -- it's a first in world-historical terms. No other country in recorded economic history has ever reached that figure.\n\nOn paper, the November data could look like a simple rebound story. In practice, it captures a deeper, newer shift in China's global economic role. Shipments to the U.S. plunged almost 29% last month, continuing a year-long slide. Yet overall exports still grew, thanks to large gains across rest of the world, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.\n\nIn effect, it shows China emerging from President Donald Trump's 2025 trade wars more or less intact, replacing U.S.-bound exports with other partners, defying what leverage Trump may have believed he had.\n\nThis diversification significantly blunts Washington's leverage. Access to the U.S. market has been the traditional pressure point in a U.S.-China trade fight. But when China can replace a sharp collapse in U.S. demand with double-digit growth elsewhere, the bite of tariffs is reduced. Supply chains may be slow to adapt and change, but once they're rerouted toward a more distributed system without the U.S. as its center or end-point, the U.S. becomes straightforwardly less important and powerful.\n\nTrade surpluses tend to signal some areas of world-beating competitiveness. But they may also reflect weak or declining domestic demand at home. And it's true that, in recent months, analysts have drawn attention to China's possibly faltering domestic economy.\n\nLikewise, dramatic trade imbalances can cause political blowback abroad, potentially inviting new rounds of tariffs and investigations from trading partners who may see such surpluses as destabilizing or unfair. Arguably, that explains in large part how China found itself embroiled in the 2025 trade wars.\n\nStill, there can be no mistaking China's export dominance -- not when it's both setting and effectively creating world records. Beijing is already doubling down on advanced manufacturing -- such as electric vehicles, robotics, batteries. Those sectors not only offer higher margins and greater profitability for producers but are also poised for huge demand growth over the next decade, so China's next long-game strategy appears clear.\n\nMeanwhile, for the rest of the world, the new milestone forces uncomfortable questions. If China can generate a trillion-dollar surplus even amid steep tariffs and slowing global growth, how much power does any other country still have to change its trajectory?",

      "body": "In a sharp turn from October's slump, China's exports surged 5.9% in November 2025 compared with a year earlier, according to data released by Chinese customs authorities.\n\nTotal outward shipments reached roughly US$ 330.3 billion, clearing economists' expectations and marking a swift rebound from October's 1.1% contraction.\n\nDespite the overall rebound, exports from China to the United States collapsed -- down nearly 29% year-over-year, continuing an eight-month streak of double-digit declines.\n\nThis steep drop reflects ongoing tensions, high tariffs, and a shifting global supply-chain strategy. The fall in U.S. shipments is being partially offset by stronger demand in other regions, including Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, and especially the European Union.\n\nIndeed, exports to the EU reportedly rose by 14.8%, and exports to Australia jumped by 35.8% in November, illustrating how Chinese traders are increasingly diversifying their customer base.\n\nMeanwhile, China's imports rose just 1.9% in November, reaching approximately US$ 218.6 billion, a modest improvement over October's 1.0% growth, but still underwhelming amid signs of continued domestic weakness.\n\nSoft domestic demand, weighed down by a sluggish property sector and weak consumer confidence, remains a key constraint on broader economic recovery.\n\nThanks to the export rebound and tepid imports, China's trade surplus has surged. For the first 11 months of 2025, the surplus has crossed the US$ 1 trillion threshold, a milestone never before reached.\n\nAnalysts attribute this surplus not only to strong global demand for Chinese goods, but also to Beijing's strategy of leaning on exports to offset weakness in domestic consumption and investment.\n\nMuch of China's export strength stems from diversification of trading partners. With U.S. demand falling, Chinese firms are increasingly targeting Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America.\n\nAdditionally, there's a structural push underway: Beijing recently reaffirmed its ambition to pivot toward advanced manufacturing, high-tech goods and value-added industries.\n\nStill, not all signs are bullish. Despite the export growth, China's factory activity contracted for an eighth consecutive month in November, a worrying indicator of domestic economic fragility.\n\nEconomists argue this could temper China's ability to sustain export momentum long-term, unless domestic demand or global order backlogs recover.",

      "body": "Exports soar despite tensions between Washington and Beijing\n\nChina's trade surplus in goods has surpassed $1 trillion (\u20ac860 billion) this year for the first time, as exports boomed despite US President Donald Trump's tariff war.\n\nIn the first 11 months of this year, China's trade surplus in dollar terms was $1.076 trillion, according to data released on Monday by the country's customs administration, which covers goods but not services.\n\nChina's trade surplus in goods for the full year in 2024 was just shy of $1tn.\n\nThe record surplus comes in the wake of a de-escalation in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, which agreed a yearlong truce in October.\n\nChina's large gap between its exports and imports has drawn criticism from its trading partners, with French President Emmanuel Macron pointing to \"unbearable\" imbalances on a visit to the country last week.\n\nThe data on Monday showed exports rose 5.9 per cent in November on a year earlier, after they fell unexpectedly in October.\n\nImports rose 1.9 per cent in November, leading to a surplus of $112 billion for the month.\n\n[ Fresh push for US tariff exemptions on whiskey and medtechOpens in new window ]\n\nChina's exports to the US have cratered in recent months, and fell 29 per cent last month year on year. But shipments to other regions, especially south-east Asia, have grown rapidly. Economists believe some of these shipments to south-east Asia, which added 8 per cent last month, are later trans-shipped to the US.\n\n\"I think the crux of the matter\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is that the US hasn't clamped down on trans-shipments of goods via third-party countries,\" said Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at UBP.\n\nHe said US demand had been \"stable\", adding: \"Because you don't see a decline in US demand, the region continues to see a surge in exports, and China is benefiting indirectly from that.\"\n\nBeijing has relied heavily on exports to drive economic activity amid weak domestic demand and a property slowdown now entering its fifth year.\n\nAt a meeting of the Communist party's politburo on economic policy, president Xi Jinping referred to the need for greater consumption, saying \"it is essential to adhere to domestic demand as the main driver, building a strong domestic market\". But he also reiterated calls to build \"new growth drivers\" -- industries powering China's exports such as electric vehicles and robots.\n\nExports to the European Union (EU) also rose sharply in November, up 14.8 per cent year on year compared with 0.9 per cent in October.\n\n\"That was the big surprise in the November data,\" said ING chief China economist Lynn Song.\n\nHe said the depreciation of the renminbi, in line with the dollar and against the euro, had also boosted the competitiveness of Chinese exports and added to its trade surplus with the bloc.\n\nHe predicted Chinese export strength would persist into next year but would face growing resistance from trade partners.\n\n\"Macron said that the EU might be potentially raising tariffs on China, so these are all uncertainties,\" Song added. \"I think also we have a slightly slower growth outlook globally, so that'll feed into the export demand side as well.\"\n\nChina was poised to increase its share of global exports to 16.5 per cent by 2030, from 15 per cent now, Morgan Stanley analysts led by chief Asia economist Chetan Ahya said in a report, adding that they doubted increasing protectionist measures from trading partners could halt this advance.\n\n\"Given its dominant position in high-growth emerging sectors like EVs, batteries, and robotics, we believe China will continue to strengthen its position in global manufacturing and trade,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nZichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, noted that \"the role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from US tariffs still appears to be increasing\" and expected the trade surplus to widen further next year. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025",

      "body": "Join the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\n\nChina's trade surplus soared to $111.7 billion last month, as exports outpaced imports by a wide margin and sparked fresh concerns among trading partners like the US and EU.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nExports from China grew 5.9% year-over-year in November, riding high on demand for ships, semiconductors, and cars. Meanwhile, imports ticked up just 1.9%, sending the trade gap to one of its widest recent levels. Not everyone is loading up, though: shipments to the US fell by nearly a third, showing that trade tensions remain despite a recent presidential truce. Industry watchers point out that the effects of US tariff tweaks haven't filtered through yet and that previous stockpiling has likely propped up recent figures. Still, exports to the EU and Japan rose, even as European leaders like France's Emmanuel Macron warn of potential tariffs if the imbalance isn't addressed.\n\nChina's swelling surplus is shaking up global trade patterns, fueling renewed volatility as Western economies discuss countermeasures. While exports to the US dip, growing shipments to Europe and Japan hint at evolving supply routes -- with investors watching closely for signs of new tariffs and shifting regulations. Those regulatory moves could reshape demand across whole industries, especially for sectors like automobiles and tech.\n\nThe bigger picture: China's pivot could reset global growth paths.\n\nChina's heavy reliance on exports keeps global supply chains in flux, but the government's long-term target is a more domestically powered economy. That shift will take time, and every strategic move is closely watched by trade partners around the world. How and when China makes this transition could influence everything from pricing and supply chain stability to broader economic growth for years to come.",

      "body": "The recent surge in Chinese exports is creating uneven effects worldwide. Cheaper Chinese goods may support purchasing power abroad, but this gain is increasingly outweighed by the strain on domestic industries struggling to compete with China's low-cost manufacturing.\n\nReports citing analysts say Beijing is pursuing a \"beggar thy neighbour\" growth model, expanding its economic reach at the expense of others. With dominance across a vast range of manufacturing sectors, China now holds significant leverage over global supply chains and its trading partners.\n\nThis reflects a widening gap between short-term consumer benefits and long-term challenges for countries whose industries face growing pressure from Chinese competition.\n\nDespite imposing tariffs, the United States has seen imports rise 10 percent year-on-year, while China's imports have fallen three percent in dollar terms.\n\nThe US jump may partly reflect firms front-running tariffs, but China's trend is structural: over the past five years, its export volumes have risen sharply while imports have stagnated. This has allowed China to capture an expanding share of the global manufactured goods market -- underscoring its \"beggar thy neighbour\" approach.\n\nA recent Goldman Sachs report illustrates how this dynamic has changed. Previously, a one percent increase in Chinese output boosted global output by 0.2 per cent through higher imports. That relationship has now turned negative.\n\nChina's current growth model is driven by its leadership's push to enhance manufacturing competitiveness and expand exports -- not by rising demand for foreign goods.\n\nCheaper Chinese goods still boost purchasing power abroad, but Goldman estimates that this benefit is more than offset by the blow to local manufacturing sectors. As China grows roughly 0.6 percentage point faster annually in the coming years, growth in the rest of the world could fall by about 0.1 percentage point per year.\n\nChina's expansion continues to benefit its own population and countries supplying inputs to its export industries. But Goldman warns that the fallout for other industrial economies -- particularly in Europe, East Asia, and Mexico -- will intensify as China deepens its export-driven strategy.",

      "body": "A Geely manufacturing plant in Hangzhou, China. Carmakers and other exporters in traditional manufacturing powerhouses like Germany, Japan and South Korea are losing customers to Chinese rivals. Picture: Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nChina got the world's attention in January when it announced that its trade surplus for goods and services had hit almost $1 trillion, an excess of exports to imports that no country had ever reached.\n\nNow China has surged through that milestone in just 11 months this year. China's customs agency announced Monday that the country's accumulated trade surplus reached $1.08 trillion through November.\n\nTariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on China have caused Chinese exports to the United States to drop by nearly a fifth. But China has throttled back its purchases of American soybeans and other products by almost the same rate, continuing to sell three times as much to the United States as it buys.\n\nChina's $111.68 billion trade surplus in November was its third-largest in a single month. The overall surplus through the first 11 months of the year is up 21.7% from the same period last year.\n\nChina has ramped up considerably its sales to other countries. From cars to solar panels to consumer electronics, a tsunami of Chinese exports is flooding Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. Carmakers and other exporters in traditional manufacturing powerhouses like Germany, Japan and South Korea are losing customers to Chinese rivals. Factories in developing countries like Indonesia and South Africa have had to curtail production or even close as they struggle to match China's low prices.\n\nChinese companies have shifted final assembly of their goods to Southeast Asia, Mexico and Africa, which then ship finished products to the United States. This has allowed them to partly bypass Trump's tariffs on goods coming straight from China.\n\nChina now sells more than twice as much to the European Union as it buys. China's trade surplus with the region has widened considerably this year.\n\nOne major reason is that China's currency has been weak over the past several years against many other currencies, particularly the euro. Another is that prices have been falling in China, while they have been rising in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe weakness of the Chinese currency, the yuan (also known as renminbi), has helped propel its exports. More than a tenth of the Chinese economy now consists of its trade surplus in manufactured goods. Europe has felt the sting sharply.\n\n\"With the renminbi undervalued by 30% against the euro, possibly more, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to compete against Chinese manufacturers even if Europe does all the right things it needs to do in terms of deregulation, bringing down energy prices and establishing a true unified market,\" said Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nChina's trade surplus in factory goods is even bigger as a share of its economy than the United States ran in the years immediately after World War II, when most other manufacturing nations were in ruins; or during the early years of World War I, when the United States was at peace and churning out civilian goods while Europe was embroiled in war.\n\nTop leaders of the International Monetary Fund, which monitors economies with the aim of preventing crises, are making their annual visit to China this week to review its currency and financial policies and are expected to announce a preliminary summary of their findings Wednesday.\n\nA growing number of economists and business leaders, including former senior officials at China's own central bank, are calling on Beijing to let the yuan increase in value against the dollar and other currencies.\n\nFor China, a stronger yuan would make goods like gasoline, French wines or Japanese cosmetics cheaper to import. Savings on such purchases would leave China's households with more money to spend on Chinese goods and services, like restaurant meals, concert tickets and electric cars.\n\nReviving consumer spending in China is one of the top goals of Beijing leaders. But doing so by allowing the yuan to strengthen would also carry costs for China.\n\nA stronger yuan would hurt China's exporters. The dollars they earn by selling goods in foreign markets would yield fewer yuan for them to pay workers and other expenses. Factories create millions of jobs in China, and a stronger yuan could slow the rate at which other countries transfer manufacturing to China.\n\nChina's export success has also financed a boom in technological innovation and has given Beijing the resources to help other authoritarian countries when they encounter difficulties, notably Russia, North Korea and Iran.\n\nChina is trying to preserve its trade surplus by pressing other countries not to erect trade barriers. \"Protectionism cannot solve the problems caused by global industrial restructuring, but will only worsen the international environment for trade,\" Xi Jinping, China's top leader, said Thursday, according to a Chinese government summary of his meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France.\n\nSome Chinese economists nonetheless say that China must someday accept a narrower trade surplus to help its long-suffering consumers.\n\n\"For China to expand domestic demand, it is necessary to minimize the trade surplus, and in the future it may even need to consider maintaining a trade deficit,\" Zhang Jun, dean of the School of Economics at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in a speech last month.",

      "title": "China's Weak Currency Is Powering Its Exports, Drawing Criticism",
      "body": "A night at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in the heart of Manhattan starts at about $2,000. A night at the Waldorf Astoria in the heart of Beijing costs about $340.\n\nHotel rooms are not all that is cheap right now in China. A Big Mac from McDonald's costs half as much in China as it does in the United States. Made-in-China goods are cheaper, too: A OnePlus 15 smartphone is $999 in the United States and $692 in China. A BYD Seal plug-in hybrid car sells for $15,500 inside China, including computer-assisted driving, and about $50,000 elsewhere, without assisted driving.\n\nLarge discrepancies between prices inside and outside China point to the biggest distortion in the global economy today: the low value of China's currency. A combination of low interest rates, slowing economic growth and government policies have kept the country's currency so weak -- undervalued by as much as a third, even some Chinese economists estimate -- that prices in China look cheap by international standards.\n\nThe weakness of China's currency, the renminbi or yuan, is not the only reason prices are low in China. A persistent and steep decline in housing has erased much of the savings of Chinese households, leaving them reluctant to spend. Chronic overcapacity at Chinese factories after years of debt-fueled investment has left companies frantically cutting prices for the fewer customers they have left inside the country.\n\nThe currency remains one of the biggest -- and most sensitive -- issues in China's economy. It takes about 7.1 renminbi to buy a single dollar these days. That weakness has powered China's exports to remarkable heights. Official data released on Monday showed that China's world surplus in exports over imports this year has already exceeded $1 trillion.\n\nChinese officials scrupulously avoid discussing the low value of the currency, which has helped create millions of jobs at Chinese export factories. But some well-connected Chinese economists are starting to say that the weakness of the renminbi is way out of line with economic fundamentals.\n\nBefore his recent retirement from China's central bank, Sheng Songcheng was the director general of its financial surveys and statistics department. He was one of the few officials with almost unlimited access to economic data in a country that releases fairly little to the outside world.\n\nNow teaching at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, Mr. Sheng gave a little-noticed talk in late November about purchasing power parity. That is the economics concept of what currency exchange rates would need to be for similar goods and services to cost the same in different countries.\n\n\"From the perspective of purchasing power parity, the exchange rate wouldn't be 1 to 7, it might be 1 to 5 or even 1 to 4,\" Mr. Sheng said at a finance conference, according to a video recording of the event. \"Some have calculated that if the exchange rate truly reflected purchasing power parity, one dollar would exchange for only about 3.5 yuan.\"\n\nIf the renminbi were to strengthen significantly past 5 to the dollar, China would pass the United States as having the world's largest economy when measured in dollars.\n\nChina's currency is so weak that the number of Chinese tourists flocking to Europe has halved since 2019 as they choose far less expensive trips at home instead. The average traveler spent just $125 for a trip during the country's weeklong national holiday at the start of October, according to government data.\n\nThe currency's recent weakness began with the two-month Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai in the spring of 2022. The lockdown caused a precipitous, nationwide plunge in consumer confidence, which has never recovered. Many Chinese households and companies have responded by selling their renminbi to buy dollars and other foreign assets, from houses to mines and companies. The investment exodus from the renminbi has also contributed to soaring prices for gold.\n\nChina's central bank responded by allowing the country's currency to fall steeply from the first days of the lockdown through the end of 2022. It has then kept the currency at roughly the same level for the past three years.\n\nThe renminbi had begun to recover slightly in the last several weeks. But the central bank stepped in Thursday to slow the gains, acting to prevent speculators from putting bets on a big appreciation of the renminbi.\n\nChanges in price levels inside and outside China have accentuated the effect from China's weak currency. While prices in China have been flat or falling for the past several years, prices have been rising elsewhere. Producer prices charged by factories and other businesses climbed 35 percent in Europe in the past five years and 26 percent in the United States.\n\nWith China's currency not strengthening to offset these changes in prices, it has become even more appealing for companies to move production to China.\n\nThe weakness of the renminbi has helped fuel a 16-fold increase in Chinese car exports to the European Union over the past five years.\n\nAnother former Chinese central banker, Miao Yanliang, told Bloomberg last week that, \"The present moment may indeed be a window of opportunity to allow for yuan appreciation.\"\n\nRuoxin Zhang contributed research.\n\nKeith Bradsher is the Beijing bureau chief for The Times. He previously served as bureau chief in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Detroit and as a Washington correspondent. He lived and reported in mainland China through the pandemic.",

      "body": "Hong Kong: China's exports returned to growth in November after an unexpected contraction in October, pushing its trade surplus in dollar terms for 2025 past the $1 trillion mark for the first time, according to data released Monday.\n\nExports climbed 5.9% from a year earlier in November while imports rose just under 2%.\n\nThe customs data released Monday also showed that shipments to the U.S. dropped nearly 29% year-on-year. But as trade with the US weakens, China is diversifying its export markets throughout Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America.\n\nChina's exports had contracted just over 1% in October. November's worldwide exports of $330.3 billion exceeded economists' estimates. Imports totalled $218.6 billion for the month.\n\nThe nearly $1.08 trillion trade surplus for the first 11 months of this year is a record high, surpassing the $992 billion surplus for all of 2024, based on official data compiled by FactSet.\n\nWhile exports from China to the US have fallen for most of the year, shipments have surged to other destinations, including Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa and the European Union.\n\nA year-long trade truce between China and the US was reached at a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in late October in South Korea. The US has lowered its tariffs on China, and China has promised to halt its export controls related to rare earths.\n\n\"It's likely that November exports have yet to fully reflect the tariff cut, which should feed through in the coming months,\" ING Bank chief economist for Greater China Lynn Song wrote in a report.\n\nChina's factory activity contracted for an eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey, and economists said it was still early to determine whether there was a real rebound in external demand following the US-China trade truce.\n\nWith exports still going strong, economists generally expect China to meet its target of around 5% annual growth for this year.\n\nChinese leaders outlined a focus on advanced manufacturing for the next five years following a high-level meeting in October.\n\nAn annual meeting was held Monday, led by Xi, to map out plans for 2026, according to the Xinhua state news agency. It said Chinese leaders reiterated a focus on \"pursuing progress while ensuring stability\".\n\nThe recent stabilisation of trade relations with Washington is unlikely to last long, said Chi Lo, Global Market Strategist, BNP Paribas Asset Management, as China-U.S. relations \"remain in a stalemate\" despite their temporary trade truce.\n\nStill, some economists believe that China will continue to gain export market share in the coming years.\n\nMorgan Stanley predicts that by 2030, China's market share in global exports will reach 16.5%, up from about 15% currently, fueled by its edge in advanced manufacturing and high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics and batteries.\n\n\"Despite persistent trade tensions, continued protectionism, and G20 economies taking up active industrial policies, we believe China will gain more share in the global goods export market,\" Morgan Stanley Chief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya said in a recent note.",

      "title": "Can We Really Believe China's GDP Numbers?",
      "body": "(Yicai) Dec. 8 -- Notwithstanding some recent weakness, China's GDP growth looks poised to hit the 5 percent target set by policymakers.\n\nThis will be a welcome surprise relative to expectations earlier this year. Given the US's imposition of punishing tariffs and the ongoing downturn in the domestic property market, the economists surveyed by Reuters in January saw China's growth slowing to 4.5 percent from the 5 percent recorded in 2024. Indeed, as recently as its Octobre 2025 World Economic Outlook, the IMF projected 4.8 percent growth this year.\n\nThis better-than-expected outturn, in the face of such significant headwinds, has led some to question the veracity of China's GDP data. For example, in \"The growing problem with China's unreliable numbers\", the Financial Times suggested that questions around the accuracy of China's GDP data have become \"more acute\".\n\nFor decades, economists have debated the quality of China's GDP numbers. In 2001, Thomas Rawski published a paper that claimed that China's \"true\" GDP growth was only one-third as rapid as the authorities claimed. In contrast, Carsten Holz, who reviewed the data and the processes that the National Bureau of Statistics used, countered that \"... one is hard pressed to find evidence of data falsification.\"\n\nCompiling national income accounts is a daunting task. Only a small subset of the data that statisticians use is actually \"countable\" - examples include fiscal revenue and expenses and the trade numbers tracked by customs officials. Most of the data that goes into constructing GDP is estimated from surveys. In addition, GDP is a value-added concept. To avoid double-counting, statisticians need to have a clear picture of all the inputs that go into the production of final goods and services. Finally, GDP is expressed in real - price adjusted - terms, which means that every good and service has to be matched with its own price deflator.\n\nI want to assess whether or not the NBS has been overstating GDP growth in recent quarters. So, I have developed a GDP proxy that does not rely on official data. At the risk of being a little wonky, let me take you through my calculations.\n\nBuilding on insights from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, I start with the data reported by China's trading partners. It is a good place to begin because these data are countable and they are not compiled by the NBS. Thus, they give an excellent third-party picture of China's international trade.\n\nI begin by adding up the imports from China reported by 102 countries that consistently provided such data over the period 2012Q1 to 2025Q2. I then make two adjustments.\n\nFirst, I eliminate the effect of price movements by converting the imports to real terms. Ideally, each one of the 102 reporting countries would have a deflator for its purchases from China. Unfortunately, few countries publish this sort of detailed information. I have to compromise here and I rely on the US's price index for its imports from China to deflate the aggregate data from the 102 countries.\n\nFigure 1 shows the evolution of the prices that US importers paid for Chinese goods. They declined modestly between 2012 and 2020 before rising rapidly during the Covid period. They have fallen from their 2022Q3 peak but remain some 10 percent higher than over 2012-14. Deflating by this price means that some of the sharp increase in imports from China during the Covid period will be eliminated and not enter into our GDP calculation.\n\nFigure 1\n\nThen I correct the data for seasonality. Global imports from China are highly seasonal, with values in the first two quarters typically much lower than those in the second two.\n\nFigure 2 shows the three versions of imports from China: the original nominal data reported by the 102 countries, the real raw values after deflating by the US import price index and the seasonally adjusted real series in terms of 2012Q1 dollars.\n\nFigure 2\n\nI have a somewhat smaller set of countries - 94 - that consistently provide data for their sales to China over the 2012Q1 - 2025Q2 period. I do not think that is problematic because the major countries are accounted for.\n\nA difficulty arises in getting a deflator for these exports. The US does provide a price for its exports to China, but the series only begins in 2018. To work around this, I jerry-rig an export deflator by estimating the relationship between the price of the US's exports to China and the price of its overall exports. I then run this relationship back to 2012. I also adjust this series for seasonality.\n\nI expect that both imports from China and exports to China will be positively correlated to China's GDP growth, with the former series telling something about China's goods exports and the latter about China's industrial demand. What I am missing is a variable to stand in for services. Here I turn to the privately produced purchasing managers index for China's service sector.\n\nA PMI is a survey of companies, which asks how business conditions currently appear compared to the previous month. They are diffusion indices, with a reading above 50 indicating an increase and below 50 a decrease in service sector activity.\n\nThe NBS produces a PMI series for services that begins in 2007. The privately produced service PMI is even more venerable. IHS Markit, a financial information company, began compiling a Chinese services PMI in 2005 under the sponsorship of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.\n\nIn 2015, Caixin Media took over sponsorship of the China PMIs from HSBC. IHS Markit continued to compile the data, which remained comparable to the pre-2015 series.\n\nIn 2022, S&P acquired IHS Markit and continued to compile the PMI.\n\nIn July 2025, Caixin concluded its sponsorship of the China PMIs, and the rights were acquired by Shenzhen-based RatingDog.\n\nThe China Services PMI continues to be compiled by S&P, which surveys purchasing managers in more than 40 countries. The China Services PMI is based on questionnaires sent to some 650 service sector companies in the consumer, transport, information, communication, finance, insurance, real estate and business services sectors.\n\nSince it is produced in China, it does not appear that the private China Services PMI is as arms-length from the Chinese authorities as the import and export data compiled by China's trading partners. It is, in theory, possible that the Chinese authorities could pressure the private PMI compilers to produce \"good news\" data. However, looking at the official and private service PMI series side-by-side, it is clear that the two measures are far from identical (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 4 shows the rolling 12-month correlations between the two PMI series. There are some times - for example, during the sharp Covid-induced slowdown in 2020 - during which the correlation between the two series is high. At other times, however, the correlation is negative. Over the last 12 months, the correlation has essentially been zero.\n\nThe proxy uses the quarterly average of the monthly private services PMI readings.\n\nFigure 4\n\nArmed with our series of imports from China, exports to China and the private services PMI, we can estimate a relationship with GDP.\n\nThe GDP measure we use here is the quarter-over-quarter percent change that the NBS reports with every national accounts release. We choose this GDP measure rather than the more popular year-over-year statistic because the PMI data are reported in terms of monthly changes and this information could get washed out in a year-over-year comparison.\n\nWe estimate the proxy over the 2012Q1 to 2023Q4 period. Figure 5 compares the fitted values of the proxy with the actual GDP growth rates reported by the NBS. Between 2012 and 2017, the proxy's fitted values indicate slower growth than the NBS's series. Moreover, its quarterly values are much more volatile. Between 2017 and 2019, the proxy's fitted values track the NBS's numbers better. The NBS's GDP data show greater volatility than the proxy during the Covid period.\n\nOver the full estimation period, the average annual growth rate of the proxy is 6.3 percent, which is identical to that of the NBS's measure. This, however, is a feature of the ordinary least squares estimation procedure.\n\nThe real test of the proxy comes during the 2024Q1 - 2025Q2 projection period. Here, we take the parameters estimated over 2012Q1 - 2023Q4 and see how well the proxy performs out of sample. If the true rate of GDP growth were well below the 5 percent the NBS publishes, then we should see that reflected in the proxy, which depends on third-party data.\n\nAs the highlighted portion of Figure 5 shows, the NBS's numbers do not lie above the values projected for the proxy. In fact, average annual growth reported by the NBS over these six quarters was 5.1 percent, slightly lower than the proxy's 5.7 percent.\n\nFigure 5\n\nThis proxy is not especially well-suited to forecast GDP, as the trade data released by China's trading parters often come out after the national accounts are released. Nevertheless, based the private PMI through November and the sub-sample of trade data released through 2025Q3, our proxy continues to suggest GDP growth in excess of 5 percent for 2025 as a whole.\n\nI have always been skeptical of the feasibility of the NBS's systematically overstating GDP growth. Policymakers need to know how the economy is actually performing.\n\nTo dispel the lack of confidence around its data, the NBS could be more transparent about the many choices it has to make in coming up with China's GDP numbers. In the meantime, benchmarking its figures against credible third-party sources provides a useful check.",

Many seem to believe that China is actually winning this round of trade war and that \"it's gameover for the US\". China is now escalating, retaliating, and experimenting with extra-territorial trade rules vis-\u00e0-vis the US with more effectiveness. It has not only pushed the Trump administration to roll back a few of his punitive tariffs but also forced Washington to face new challenges, such as exposing its supply chain vulnerabilities, spurring growing international scepticism about American reliability, declining global influence, etc. All these spell a strategic victory for China, and behind this success, it is argued, is the strength of 'Made in China'.\n\nThe popular discourse in China, therefore, is that the Sino-US game has tested China's resilience and forced the US and the world to reassess China's capability and recognise China as a \"risen power\". No wonder China has been celebrating.\n\nChinese exports have maintained good momentum despite the disruptions caused by the Trump tariffs. Its exports grew by 7 percent in 2025 till September. Even after losing much of the US market, China's enormous global trade surplus remains intact. In the first eight months of 2025, China's trade surplus in goods reached US$785.34 billion, and is expected to exceed US$1.2 trillion for the entire year, accounting for 1 percent of the global GDP. China's manufacturing now accounts for nearly 30 percent of the global total, and its overall scale has remained the world's largest for 15 consecutive years. Meanwhile, 'Made in China' has become the economic foundation of many developing countries, including India. The popular discourse in China, therefore, is that the Sino-US game has tested China's resilience and forced the US and the world to reassess China's capability and recognise China as a \"risen power\". No wonder China has been celebrating.\n\nBut the celebration is momentary as China faces mounting concerns elsewhere: its domestic economy. Although China's manufacturing exports are performing well globally, Chinese observers are of the opinion that the huge surplus China earns through its manufacturing exports has not been able to add sufficient vitality to China's domestic economy. It either circulates in the books or is used for overseas activities.\n\nThere is a growing consensus within China that the Chinese economy is currently facing a situation never seen in the past 40 years, and that the Chinese economy could never truly recover from the pandemic. The reason is that the PPI (Producer Price Index) has been negative for three consecutive years, declining every month. Three years of negative PPI and more than two years of near-zero consumer price index (CPI) indicate a slump unprecedented in China's four decades of economic development. There is also the continuous decline in prices and pressure on corporate profits, resulting from serious involution in various key sectors of the economy. Coupled with the downturn in real estate prices that began in 2021, consumption is shrinking. Now, with foreign direct investment (FDI) declining, the risk of industrial chains moving abroad looming large, market costs rising, population shrinking and consumption diminishing, pressure is also building up on the employment space.\n\nPrecisely at this stage, when consumption should be driving China's growth -- and accounting for 70-80 percent of Chinese GDP -- instead, consumption has been weakening, especially in the past two years.\n\nNow, the key question doing the rounds in Chinese strategic circles is why Chinese consumption isn't picking up, despite high-level government intervention. In cases of most developing countries, when per capita GDP reaches US$13,000-14,000, the export-driven effect will gradually weaken, and consumption becomes the primary driver. Most developed countries run trade deficits because they have more money to spend, so they export less. But in China's case, this is clearly not happening. Although its per capita GDP has already reached US$13,000-14,000, most of the highways and airports that needed to be built have already been completed. Precisely at this stage, when consumption should be driving China's growth -- and accounting for 70-80 percent of Chinese GDP -- instead, consumption has been weakening, especially in the past two years.\n\nOne explanation, that is fast gaining currency in Chinese strategic circles, is that the government's techno-nationalism, particularly post-2018, its single-minded focus on strengthening independent innovation, has proven counterproductive. Yao Yang, professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, argues that the Chinese government has somehow pitted the development of hard technology and innovation in opposition to developing consumption, finance, and real estate. It is almost as if engaging in consumption and real estate would hinder innovation, causing China to lose against the US. But it is now becoming clear that although China's current technological level has already become quite high, it cannot prevent the Chinese economy from entering a phase of prolonged recession. It is now being argued that China cannot escape its current economic predicament of severe liquidity crunch (caused by the contraction of the capital market, with real estate at its core) by simply overcoming technological bottlenecks and establishing an independent domestic industrial chain. Without sufficient domestic demand, Chinese economists warn, the stronger China's manufacturing, military, and technology is, the more severe is its domestic economic crisis. They caution that, before World War II, the United States held a 40 percent global manufacturing share, higher than China's current 30 percent, yet it suffered a depression unprecedented in human history. They say the same is becoming true for China today.\n\nPrecisely at this stage, when consumption should be driving China's growth -- and accounting for 70-80 percent of Chinese GDP -- instead, consumption has been weakening, especially in the past two years.\n\nThe other explanation to China's current economic challenges, put forward by certain Chinese economists is that when it comes to boosting consumption, the government's policies so far are focusing on measures like subsidies, tax cuts, cash handouts, stabilising employment, increasing residents' share of income distribution, increasing transfer payments, and boosting social security and public welfare spending, etc, while avoiding structural issues like the real estate. It is argued that if real estate prices continue to decline for a long time, overall demand can only stagnate. Local governments, lacking revenue, will be reluctant to invest, making it difficult for domestic demand to pick up.\n\nFrom that perspective, de-risking and deflating the real estate bubble in the past few years were \"serious mistakes\", opined Zhao Yanjing, Professor at Xiamen University and Vice President of the China Urban Planning Society. He further added that the universal crackdown on real estate has hit China's middle class; as a result, domestic demand is unable to pick up. The Chinese strategic community thus want the government to re-examine its long-held stance regarding debt expansion, particularly treating real estate as taboo, or obsessing over the real economy (that is, strong technology, production, and military), or shying away from expanding debt, referring to Japan's experience of losing three decades.\n\nThe core proposition now is that the government must stop strengthening the supply side during this period of shrinking demand, which is creating more oversupply and dragging down the domestic economy. Meanwhile, internationally, China's overwhelming productivity is putting it on a collusive course not just against the US but also the European Union, India, among others. Countries with large markets are increasingly seeing China as their biggest threat and devising protectionist measures against it. From that perspective, China's superior productivity, which is the key to China's global status, is also proving as its greatest weakness under the current circumstances.\n\nThe US's unrivalled position in today's global tariff war is precisely due to its monopoly over global debt, and China must emulate that.\n\nInstead, Chinese observers argue China should now focus on finance, not manufacturing, explore options like boosting the stock market, stabilising housing prices (preventing its continuous fall), and stabilising local government debt, that is, measures that can create money and expand domestic demand, without accumulating excess capacity. In other words, rather than competing head-on with other exporting countries where the US is trying to shift the supply chains, China, they say, needs to change the battlefield and compete with the US directly for the title of \"global client\" by forcefully expanding its own debt. It is neither asset-constrained like Japan, nor presently facing labour shortage and hence must think out of the box to break the recessionary spiral. The US's unrivalled position in today's global tariff war is precisely due to its monopoly over global debt, and China must emulate that.\n\nSuch discussions about course correction by China's prominent economists and strategists, although found limited expression in China's recently released 15 Five-Year plan, however, seem to have triggered widespread apprehension among common Chinese netizens, who are increasingly losing confidence about the future of the Chinese economy. The policy conundrum is also making the public opinion in China more aggressive, strongly unwilling to relocate manufacturing overseas, without distinguishing between low-end and high-end industries. Similarly, there are voices advocating a complete blockade of rare earth elements and other strategic resources, preventing even a single gram from disappearing overseas.\n\nAs India considers economic re-engagement with China, it must make a greater effort to understand the turmoil that has gripped the world's second-largest economy. It needs to be careful in its China strategy, neither blindly accepting the \"China is winning\" narrative, nor underestimating the resilience of the Chinese economy or the efficiency of the Chinese system in steering the economy out of crisis.\n\nAntara Ghosal Singh is a Fellow with the Strategic Studies Programme at the Observer Research Foundation.\n\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

      "body": "Not the US, the EU, Germany, the UK, or Japan, China has recorded the world's biggest trade surplus of $1 trillion. According to Bloomberg, China's exports rebounded in November after an unexpected fall in the previous month and crossed the psychological limit of $1 trillion. After the exports soared 5.9% with an increase in imports of 1.9%, the total trade surplus was registered at $112 billion, a world record so far. It occurred despite the US-China trade war and imposition of higher tariffs on Chinese products. It also shows how Beijing managed its economy and steered it away from dependence on US demands. The Chinese exports account for almost a third of economic growth in 2025.\n\nUS-China trade war\n\nThe Chinese economy suffered in October as its shipments to the US fell 29%, registering double-digit declines in the eighth month and the biggest since August. However, growth in the exports to the markets of the European Union, Latin America, and Africa did offset the slump. Despite US President Donald Trump's launch of a trade war early in 2025, the overseas shipment continued to increase for a bigger part of the year.\n\nChina's export growth\n\nAs the exports to France, Germany, and Italy recorded a double-digit growth, the sales to the EU increased 15%, the biggest rise since 2022. Similarly, exports to Africa soared nearly 28%. However, the sales to the 10-nation Southeast Asian trading bloc gained only 8.4%, the least since February.",

      "title": "China's trade surplus with the world tops $1 trillion, despite tariffs",
      "body": "China's trade surplus with the rest of the world has topped $1 trillion for the first time, news that calls into question the effectiveness of developed countries' -- and especially President Donald Trump's -- attempts to stem the flood of manufactured goods flowing out of China.\n\nChina's General Administration of Customs said Monday that for the first 11 months of the year, exports increased by 5.4 percent compared with the same period last year, while imports fell slightly. That meant China ran a global trade surplus of $1.07 trillion, exceeding the $990 billion surplus recorded for the whole of 2024.\n\n\"Put simply, China's price competitiveness is extremely strong,\" said Xu Tianchen, a senior economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing. \"The main reason behind the continued growth of China's exports ... is not ... because the overall size of global trade has expanded, but because China is claiming a larger share of the existing trade landscape.\"\n\nExports to the U.S. fell 28 percent in November compared to the same month last year, an even greater decline than the 25 percent annual drop recorded in October, according to the official data.\n\nThis comes after an October meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when a trade truce negotiated between the two sides earlier in the year was extended. Trump cut tariffs on imports from China and Xi agreed to resume purchasing soybeans and to delay restrictions on rare earth mineralsfor a year.\n\nXi signaled a willingness to travel to the U.S. early next year, and Trump has said he would likely travel to Beijing in April, and both sides will be aiming to have a more permanent trade agreement ready to be signed by then, analysts said.\n\nXi went into the October meeting feeling confident, analysts said, because Trump's tariff onslaught had not caused much damage to export-dependent China, even as its domestic economy was ailing. The latest data shows this trend is continuing, despite a blip in October.\n\nThat is partly because China appears to be \"transshipping\" more goods through Southeast Asia, despite the Trump administration's attempts to crack down on the practice.\n\nMonday's figures showed an 8 percent annual jump in the first 11 months of the year in Chinese exports to Southeast Asia, where Chinese-made goods can be assembled and shipped on to the U.S. market.\n\nChina's exports to Southeast Asia have grown strongly, Xu said. \"A large part of that is likely products that were ultimately destined for the U.S., but now make a stop in Southeast Asia.\"\n\nIt was also notable that the decline in U.S. exports was made up by a surge in China's exports to the rest of the world.\n\nThat will be of particular concern in the European Union, where exports rose at an annual rate of 14.8 percent in November.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, returning from a state visit to China, threatened to impose tariffs if Beijing did not take action to reduce its enormous trade surplus with the E.U. China sold more than 300 billion euros ($350 billion) worth of goods to the E.U. more than it bought last year.\n\n\"I told them that if they don't react, we Europeans will be forced to take strong measures in the coming months,\" Macron told Les Echos, the French business newspaper, in an interview published Sunday. Tariffs could be modeled after those imposed by the United States, he said.\n\nFor countries like Germany, where automobile manufacturing makes up some 5 percent of gross domestic product, an especially worrying number was that for China's exports of cars worldwide: That soared 53 percent in November, up from an already extraordinary 34 percent rise in October.",

      "body": "China's latest trade snapshot revealed a striking split in its global business: strong overall export growth paired with a steep collapse in shipments to the United States.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the contrast underscored how Beijing's trade direction is shifting even as a new truce with Washington begins to take hold.\n\nCustoms data released Monday showed China's exports climbed 5.9% in November compared to the same month last year, totaling $330.3 billion.\n\nThe improvement followed an unexpected contraction in October and outpaced economists' forecasts. Imports also ticked up, rising 1.9% to more than $218.6 billion.\n\nStill, the headline number masked deeper turbulence. Shipments to the U.S. plunged nearly 29% year-over-year -- the eighth straight month of double-digit declines -- even as exports surged to other regions, including Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the European Union.\n\nThe widening gap between exports and imports pushed China's trade surplus for the first 11 months of the year to nearly $1.08 trillion. That figure has already exceeded the nation's full-year record of $992 billion set in 2024.\n\nAnalysts said the November rebound may not yet capture the effects of the renewed trade truce reached in late October during the meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the U.S. rolled back certain tariffs while China committed to ending export controls tied to rare earth materials.\n\n\"It's likely that November exports have yet to fully reflect the tariff cut, which should feed through in the coming months,\" said Lynn Song, ING Bank's chief economist for Greater China.\n\nEven with stronger export numbers, China's broader economic signals remain mixed. Factory activity contracted for an eighth straight month, and the ongoing property slump continues to drag on consumer confidence and business investment.\n\nEconomists caution that it may take several months to see whether external demand is experiencing a true rebound following the trade truce.\n\nChinese officials appear focused on shoring up long-term stability. Xi presided over an annual economic planning conference on Monday, outlining goals for 2026 that emphasize \"pursuing progress while ensuring stability.\" Leaders reaffirmed a strategy centered on advanced manufacturing over the next five years.\n\nGlobal uncertainty remains a persistent threat. Chi Lo, a strategist with BNP Paribas Asset Management, warned that calm conditions may not last as China-U.S. relations \"remain in a stalemate\" despite the temporary easing of trade tensions.\n\nStill, some analysts see China strengthening its position in the global export market. Morgan Stanley projects the nation's share of worldwide goods exports will rise from roughly 15% today to 16.5% by 2030, driven by growth in high-tech sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics, and battery production.\n\n\"Despite persistent trade tensions, continued protectionism, and G20 economies taking up active industrial policies, we believe China will gain more share in the global goods export market,\" said Chetan Ahya, the firm's Chief Asia Economist.",

      "body": "HONG KONG (AP) -- China's exports returned to growth in November after an unexpected contraction in October, pushing its trade surplus in dollar terms for 2025 past the $1 trillion mark for the first time, according to data released Monday.\n\nExports climbed 5.9% from a year earlier in November while imports rose just under 2%.\n\nThe customs data released on Monday also showed that shipments to the U.S. dropped nearly 29% year-on-year. But as trade with the U.S. weakens, China is diversifying its export markets throughout Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America.\n\nChina's exports had contracted just over 1% in October. November's worldwide exports of $330.3 billion exceeded economists' estimates. Imports totaled $218.6 billion for the month.\n\nThe nearly $1.08 trillion trade surplus for the first 11 months of this year is a record high, surpassing the $992 billion surplus for all of 2024, based on official data compiled by FactSet.\n\nWhile exports from China to the U.S. have fallen for most of the year, shipments have surged to other destinations, including Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa and the European Union.\n\nA year-long trade truce between China and the U.S. was reached at a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in late October in South Korea. The U.S. has lowered its tariffs on China, and China has promised to halt its export controls related to rare earths.\n\n\"It's likely that November exports have yet to fully reflect the tariff cut, which should feed through in the coming months,\" ING Bank chief economist for Greater China Lynn Song wrote in a report.\n\nChina's factory activity contracted for an eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey, and economists said it was still early to determine whether there was a real rebound in external demand following the U.S.-China trade truce.\n\nWith exports still going strong, economists generally expect China to meet its target of around 5% annual growth for this year.\n\nChinese leaders outlined a focus on advanced manufacturing for the next five years following a high-level meeting in October.\n\nAn annual meeting was held on Monday, led by Xi, to map out plans for 2026, according to the Xinhua state news agency. It said Chinese leaders reiterated a focus on \"pursuing progress while ensuring stability\".\n\nThe recent stabilization of trade relations with Washington is unlikely to last long, said Chi Lo, Global Market Strategist, BNP Paribas Asset Management, as China-U.S. relations \"remain in a stalemate\" despite their temporary trade truce.\n\nStill, some economists believe that China will continue to gain export market share in coming years.\n\nMorgan Stanley predicts by 2030, China's market share in global exports will reach 16.5%, up from about 15% currently, fueled by its edge in advanced manufacturing and high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics and batteries.\n\n\"Despite persistent trade tensions, continued protectionism, and G20 economies taking up active industrial policies, we believe China will gain more share in the global goods export market,\" Morgan Stanley Chief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya said in a recent note.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Associated Press.

      "body": "China's exports beat forecasts in November, largely due to a surge in shipments to countries other than the U.S., as manufacturers deepen global trade ties to mitigate the effects of President Donald Trump's steep tariffs.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy has ramped up efforts to diversify its export markets since Trump won last November's presidential election, pursuing closer trade ties with Southeast Asia and the European Union, and leveraging Chinese firms' global footprint to establish new production hubs for low-tariff access.\n\nChina's exports grew 5.9% year-over-year, customs data showed on Monday, reversing from a 1.1% contraction a month prior, and beating a 3.8% forecast in surveys.\n\nImports were up 1.9%, compared to a 1% uptick in October. Economists had expected a 3% increase.\n\n\"The tariff cuts agreed under the U.S.-China trade truce didn't help to lift shipments to the U.S. last month, but overall export growth rebounded nonetheless,\" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. \"We expect China's exports will remain resilient, with the country continuing to gain global market share next year.\"\n\n\"The role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from U.S. tariffs still appears to be increasing,\" she added.\n\nThe average U.S. tariff on Chinese goods stands at 47.5%, well above the 40% threshold that economists say erodes Chinese exporters' profit margins.\n\nChinese shipments to the U.S. dropped 29% in November year-over-year, the data shows, even though the month began with news that the United States and China had agreed to scale back some of their tariffs and a raft of other measures after Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea on Oct. 30.\n\nExports to the European Union grew by an annual 14.8% last month, while shipments to Australia surged 35.8%, and the fast-growing Southeast Asian economies took in 8.2% more goods over the same period.\n\nThat boosted China's trade surplus to $111.68 billion in November, the highest since June, from $90.07 billion recorded the previous month, and above a forecast of $100.2 billion.\n\nThe trade surplus for the 11 months of the year topped $1 trillion for the first time.\n\n\"Electronic machinery and semiconductors seem to be key,\" said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group.\n\n\"There is a shortage in lower-grade chips and other electronics, which meant prices jumped, and Chinese companies going global have been importing all kinds of machinery and other inputs from China.\"\n\nChina's yuan firmed on Monday, off the back of the stronger-than-expected export data, with investors also awaiting policy signals from key year-end meetings.\n\nThe Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged on Monday to take steps to expand domestic demand, a shift analysts say is crucial for weaning the $19 trillion economy away from reliance on exports.\n\nTop officials are also expected to convene for the annual Central Economic Work Conference in the coming days to set key targets and outline policy priorities for next year.\n\nEconomists estimate that diminished access to the U.S. market since Trump returned to the White House has reduced China's export growth by roughly 2 percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3% of GDP.\n\nOctober's unexpected downturn, following an 8.3% surge the month prior, signalled that Chinese exporters' tactic of front-loading U.S.-bound shipments to beat Trump's tariffs had run its course.\n\nAlthough Chinese factory owners reported an improvement in new export orders in November, they were still in contraction, underscoring continued uncertainty for manufacturers as they struggle to replace demand in the absence of U.S. buyers.\n\nAn official survey tracking broader factory activity showed that the sector contracted for an eighth consecutive month.\n\nChina's rare earth exports jumped 26.5% month-over-month in November, the first full month after Xi and Trump agreed to speed up shipment of the critical minerals from the world's largest refiner.\n\nThe nation's soybean imports are also poised for their best-ever year, as Chinese buyers, who had shunned U.S. purchases for the majority of this year, stepped up purchases from American growers in addition to large purchases from Latin America.\n\nOverall, China's domestic demand remains soft due to a prolonged property downturn.\n\nThat weakness was seen in a decline in imports of unwrought copper, a key material in construction and manufacturing.\n\n\"China's pivot to establishing domestic demand as a key driver of growth will take time, but it's essential for China to move into the next phase in its economic development,\" said Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China.",

The National Financial Regulatory Administration rolled back key restrictions, making it much easier for insurance firms to put money into stocks. That move especially buoyed financial shares, with the CSI Investment Banking and Brokerage Index rallying 2% and the insurance index up 1%. Shares of Ping An, China's second-largest insurer, rose 2%, showing investor excitement about the changes. On top of that, strong export numbers delivered a record $1.12 trillion trade surplus in November. Even outside finance, healthcare stocks like Jiangsu Aidea Pharmaceutical saw a lift after its drugs made the national reimbursement list for another year, hinting at ongoing momentum from supportive policies.\n\nWhy should I care?\n\nFor markets: Policy shifts spark investor optimism.\n\nLooser rules and a historic trade surplus have put the wind back in the sails of Chinese equities. Investors are pouring fresh capital into financial and healthcare names, showing how policy tweaks can quickly revive market appetite. If these supportive measures keep coming and global demand holds steady, China's market rebound could have staying power.\n\nThe bigger picture: China's economic moves send global ripples.\n\nChina's eye-popping trade surplus strengthens not just its domestic markets, but can also shake up worldwide trade flows and supply chains. With insurance rules easing, policymakers are clearly signaling a push for growth and stability. For investors around the world, that's a reminder that China's policy toolkit remains an important force in global markets.",

      "body": "China's trade surplus for the first 11 months of this year has surpassed the $1 trillion mark, at nearly $1.08 trillion. This is a record high for any single year and exceeds last year's total surplus of $992 billion, according to official data compiled by FactSet. The customs data highlights a widening gap between China's overall exports and imports during this period.\n\nDespite the fall in exports to the US, China has seen a surge in shipments to other regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the European Union. In November, China's imports grew by 1.9% to over $218.6 billion, better than October's 1% growth. This comes even as a prolonged slump in the property sector continues to weigh on consumer spending and business investment.\n\nA year-long trade truce between China and the US was reached at a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in late October. The US has cut tariffs on China while China has agreed to lift export controls on rare earths. \"It's likely that November exports have yet to fully reflect the tariff cut, which should feed through in the coming months,\" wrote Lynn Song, ING Bank's Chief Economist for Greater China.\n\nChina's factory activity contracted for the eighth straight month in November, an official survey showed. Economists say it is too early to tell if external demand has truly rebounded after the US-China trade truce. However, with strong exports, most economists expect China to meet its economic growth target of around 5% this year.\n\nAfter a high-level meeting in October, Chinese leaders had emphasized a focus on advanced manufacturing for the next five years. An annual economic planning meeting was held on Monday, led by Xi, to chart out growth plans for 2026. Despite persistent trade tensions and protectionism, some economists believe China will continue to gain export market share in the coming years.",

      "body": "China's exports of rare earths accelerated in November, as it shipped out 5,494 tons of the critical minerals, up 24% from a year earlier.\n\nChina's U.S.-bound goods fell for an eighth straight month despite a recent trade deal between the two economies, even as overall exports surpassed market expectations in November as manufacturers loaded up shipments to other markets.\n\nOutbound shipments surged 5.9% last month in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier, China's customs data showed Monday, topping economists' forecast for a 3.8% growth in a Reuters poll. That growth marked a rebound from an unexpected 1.1% drop in October -- the first contraction since March 2024.\n\nImports rose 1.9% last month, missing expectations for a 3% rise, as a protracted housing downturn and rising job insecurity continued to be drag on domestic consumption. Growth was higher compared to 1% in October.\n\nChinese officials have renewed pledges to expand imports and work toward balancing trade amid widespread criticism against its aggressive exports.\n\nExports to the U.S. plunged 28.6% in November, marking the eighth straight month of double-digit declines in shipments to the world's largest consumer market, even after President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump reached a deal in South Korea in late October. Imports from America shrank 19% from a year earlier.\n\n\"Despite the trade truce, the U.S. still imposes higher tariffs on China than on [many] other countries,\" said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, adding that Chinese exporters have likely continued to utilize their facilities in third markets to export to the U.S. \"It can become a future norm,\" Ng noted.\n\nLevies on Chinese goods remain at around 47.5% according to Peterson Institute for International Economics. Beijing's tariffs on imports from the U.S. stand at around 32%.\n\nSo far this year, China's exports to the U.S. have declined 18.9% year on year, while imports have dropped 13.2%.\n\nShrinking U.S. exports in November were more than offset by surging shipments to other markets, particularly China's two largest trading blocs, the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. China's exports to ASEAN and the EU rose over over 8% and nearly 15%, respectively.\n\nIn the first 11 months this year, China's overall exports grew 5.4% compared to the same period in 2024 while imports fell 0.6%, taking its trade surplus to $1.076 trillion this year as of November, up 21.6% year on year.\n\nChina's exports of rare earths accelerated in November, as it shipped out 5,494 tons of the critical minerals, up 24% from a year earlier and compared with 4,343.5 tons in October. The Ministry of Commerce has reportedly been designing a new rare earth licensing regime that could expedite shipments.\n\nThe country's overall soybean imports grew 13% from a year earlier to 8.1 million metric tons in November, although down from the October level, signaling a slow start to fulfilling its promise of purchasing 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by year-end.\n\nThe rebound of export growth would help mitigate the drag from weak domestic demand, putting the economy on track to deliver the \"around 5%\" growth target this year, said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\n\nBeijing is expected to keep the 2026 growth target unchanged at \"around 5%,\" according to Goldman Sachs, which would require incremental policy easing early next year to ensure a growth acceleration from a likely lackluster reading in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nChina's factory activity shrank for an eighth month in November, an official manufacturing survey showed, with new orders staying in contraction. A private survey focused on exporters showed manufacturing activity unexpectedly fell into contraction.\n\nThe Wall Street bank expects Chinese authorities to lift the augmented fiscal deficit ceiling by 1 percentage point of GDP, cut policy rates by a total of 20 basis points and step up stimulus measures to rein in the housing slump.\n\nThe strengthening yuan in recent weeks has not appeared to stem the flow of China's exports. The offshore yuan has strengthened nearly 5% since April to 7.0669 per dollar at market open on Monday, according to LSEG data.\n\nDespite a steady 5% annual GDP growth since 2023, China \"urgently needs to curb its export dependence and pivot towards domestic consumption to ensure sustainable expansion,\" Weijian Shan, chief executive of private equity firm PAG, said in an opinion piece last month.\n\nA stronger yuan could boost consumption's contribution to economic growth to the 2023 level of 86% from currently 53%, as it would lower costs of imports and enhance household purchasing power, Shan added.",

Leaders pledged to boost domestic demand and keep supportive fiscal and monetary policies rolling through 2026, aiming for stronger growth. Regulators also eased rules for major financial companies, lowering capital and leverage barriers to encourage more institutional investment. The insurance regulator's move to cut risk factors on certain equity holdings freed up extra capital, which Goldman Sachs suggests could attract more big players to the market. Meanwhile, exports topped expectations, helped by a recent US tariff truce, and China's homegrown tech and chip stocks rallied on optimism around artificial intelligence. Even property names rebounded slightly, steadying after last week's swings.\n\nChina's policy support is designed to pull long-term capital back into local stocks, potentially calming the market after a turbulent stretch. Looser rules for insurers and big institutions mean more cash could flow into equities, tightening the gap with global valuations. That said, some caution remains, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipping and tech indices mostly flat. The next moves will hinge on updates from China's all-important Central Economic Work Conference.\n\nThe bigger picture: Policy moves aim to steady China's growth path.\n\nThese fresh policy steps land as global uncertainty lingers and demand from abroad stays shaky. Gains in domestic technology and chipmakers show China's push for self-reliance, while export strength adds stability. If these measures gain traction, they could help cement confidence in China's longer-term outlook and influence capital flows far beyond the country's borders.",

      "body": "In April this year, Trump sharply raised tariffs, starting with a 10 per cent baseline duty on all imports and a 34 per cent tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nChina's exports grew strongly in November, helping its trade surplus cross $1 trillion for the first time, Bloomberg reported. This came even as the exports dipped unexpectedly in the last month.\n\nChina's exports were up 5.9 per cent from last year, higher than expected, while imports rose only 1.9 per cent, creating a monthly surplus of $112 billion. Overall, China's trade surplus for the first 11 months of the year is 21.7 per cent higher than the same period last year.\n\nChina sells more to US than it buys\n\nChina's record trade surplus comes soon after tensions with the Trump administration eased. Trump's tariffs caused China's exports to the US to fall by almost 20 per cent. But China also cut its purchases of US goods by a similar amount. According to the New York Times, China still sells about three times more to the US than it buys.\n\nIn April this year, Trump sharply raised tariffs, starting with a 10 per cent baseline duty on all imports and a 34 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, while ending duty-free access for small Chinese shipments. China hit back with the same 34 per cent tariff, export curbs, and bans on some US farm products, leading both countries to rapidly push tariffs up to 84 per cent and then 125 per cent within days.\n\nAfter weeks of escalation, both sides agreed in May to a 90-day tariff pause, cutting duties sharply. Talks continued through July and August, with the US urging China to buy more soybeans. On August 11, both countries extended their tariff truce for another 90 days.\n\nChina ramps up exports\n\nAccording to the New York Times, China has also ramped up its sales to other countries. China is sending huge amounts of cars, solar panels and electronics to Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. This has caused big manufacturers in countries like Germany, Japan and South Korea to lose customers to cheaper Chinese products.\n\nFactories in developing nations such as Indonesia and South Africa are also cutting production or shutting down because they cannot compete with China's low prices.\n\nMore From This Section\n\nAs tensions flare on Israel-Lebanon border, communities struggle to rebuild\n\nUN aid agency cuts appeal for 2026 to $33 bn after lowest annual support\n\nA year after Assad's fall, Syrians and their country struggle to heal\n\nChina's exports grow 5.9% in November despite 29% drop in US shipments\n\nUS defence bill pushes deeper engagement with India, including via Quad",

      "title": "China surpasses $1 trillion trade surplus despite low exports to US",
      "body": "China's annual trade surplus surpassed $1 trillion for the first time, reaching about $1.1 trillion after 11 months and exceeding the previous full-year record set in 2024, according to official data released on Friday.\n\nThe threshold was crossed as exports rebounded in November, rising 5.9% from a year earlier and outpacing a 1.9% increase in imports. The performance generated a monthly trade surplus of $111.68 billion, the third-largest China has ever recorded and stronger than economists had forecast.\n\nThe $1 trillion landmark was achieved despite steep US tariffs, which continued to weigh on shipments to the United States. Exports to the US fell 29% in November, marking an eighth straight month of double-digit declines. Manufacturers expanded trade ties elsewhere, however, more than offsetting the slump. Shipments to the European Union grew almost 15% last month, the fastest pace since July 2022, while exports to Africa climbed nearly 28%.\n\nElectronics and machinery exports rose nearly 10%, reflecting firm global demand for industrial and technology goods.\n\nChina's expanding trade surplus has added to tensions with key partners. French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that the EU may take \"strong measures,\" including tariffs, if Beijing does not address the imbalance. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul recently raised concerns about trade curbs, rare-earth access and industrial \"overcapacities\" in sectors such as steel and electric vehicles.\n\nEconomists say rising frictions with the EU pose a significant risk to China's external demand outlook. Still, foreign demand has been the most consistent driver of growth this year, offsetting a prolonged housing downturn and weak consumer spending. Net exports have accounted for nearly one-third of China's economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe record surplus is expected to support full-year GDP growth, keeping the government's target of around 5% within reach. Analysts, however, note that the economy remains highly reliant on overseas markets. Soft domestic demand and increased self-sufficiency among Chinese firms have limited import growth, reinforcing the surplus while underscoring structural imbalances.\n\nOfficials have said stronger domestic demand is \"ultimately essential\" to reduce dependence on exports, though economists expect the transition to be gradual. Until then, China's exposure to global markets and foreign trade actions will remain a key uncertainty.",

Economists had expected a 3.0 per cent increase.\n\n\"The tariff cuts agreed under the US-China trade truce didn't help to lift shipments to the US last month, but overall export growth rebounded nonetheless,\" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. \"We expect China's exports will remain resilient, with the country continuing to gain global market share next year.\"\n\n\"The role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from U.S. tariffs still appears to be increasing,\" she added.\n\nThe average US tariff on Chinese goods stands at 47.5 per cent, well above the 40 per cent threshold that economists say erodes Chinese exporters' profit margins.\n\nChinese shipments to the US dropped 29 per cent in November year-on-year, the data shows, even though the month began with news that the United States and China had agreed to scale back some of their tariffs and a raft of other measures after Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea on Oct 30.\n\nExports to the European Union grew an annual 14.8 per cent last month, while shipments to Australia surged 35.8 per cent, and the fast-growing Southeast Asian economies took in 8.2 per cent more goods over the same period.\n\nThat boosted China's trade surplus to US$111.68 billion in November, the highest since June, from US$90.07 billion recorded the previous month, and above a forecast of US$100.2 billion.\n\nThe trade surplus for the 11 months of the year topped $1 trillion for the first time.\n\n\"Electronic machinery and semiconductors seem to be key,\" said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group. \"There is a shortage in lower-grade chips and other electronics, which meant prices jumped, and Chinese companies going global have been importing all kinds of machinery and other inputs from China.\"",

The US has lowered its tariffs on China, and China has promised to halt its export controls related to rare earths.\n\n\"It's likely that November exports have yet to fully reflect the tariff cut, which should feed through in the coming months,\" ING Bank chief economist for Greater China Lynn Song wrote in a report.\n\nChina's factory activity contracted for an eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey, and economists said it was still early to determine whether there was a real rebound in external demand following the US-China trade truce.\n\nWith exports still going strong, economists generally expect China to more or less meet its economic growth target of around 5 percent for this year.\n\nChinese leaders had outlined a focus on advanced manufacturing for the next five years following a high-level meeting in October.\n\nAn annual economic planning meeting was held on Monday, led by Xi, to map out economic growth plans for 2026, according to state news agency Xinhua, as Chinese leaders reiterated a focus on \"pursuing progress while ensuring stability\".\n\nA stable global trade environment is not likely to last long, said Chi Lo, Global Market Strategist, BNP Paribas Asset Management, as China-US relations \"remain in a stalemate\" despite their temporary trade truce.\n\nStill, some economists believe that China will continue to gain export market share in the coming years.\n\nMorgan Stanley predicts that by 2030, China's market share in global exports will reach 16.5 percent, up from about 15 percent currently, fueled by its edge in advanced manufacturing and high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics and batteries.\n\n\"Despite persistent trade tensions, continued protectionism, and G20 economies taking up active industrial policies, we believe China will gain more share in the global goods export market,\" Morgan Stanley Chief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya said in a recent note.

      "body": "China's exports bounced back in November after a surprising decline in October, although shipments to the United States fell nearly 29% year-on-year for the eighth consecutive month of double-digit drops.\n\nCustoms data released today (8 December) showed overall exports grew 5.9% in dollar terms to $330.3 billion, surpassing economists' expectations. This followed a 1.1% contraction in October. While exports to the US remain weak, shipments to other regions, including Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have surged.\n\nChina's imports also rose 1.9% in November, an improvement over October's 1% growth, despite ongoing pressure from the property sector affecting consumer spending and business investment.\n\nThe growth follows a year-long trade truce between China and the US, reached during a late-October meeting in South Korea between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. As part of the truce, the U.S. reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, and China agreed to halt certain export controls on rare earths.\n\n\"While the trade truce and US tariff reductions should support Chinese exports, we are entering a period of unfavorable base effects,\" wrote ING Bank economists Lynn Song and Deepali Bhargava, noting strong export growth last year ahead of Trump's tariff hikes. \"This should keep trade growth modest.\"\n\nDespite exports holding up, China's factory activity contracted for the eighth consecutive month, and economists say it is too early to determine whether the trade truce has sparked a real rebound in external demand. Analysts generally expect China to meet its annual growth target of around 5% this year.\n\nChinese leaders recently outlined plans to focus on advanced manufacturing over the next five years, with details expected at an upcoming economic planning meeting. However, BNP Paribas strategist Chi Lo warned that a stable global trade environment is unlikely, given the ongoing stalemate in China-US relations.\n\nStill, some economists are optimistic about China's long-term export prospects. Morgan Stanley forecasts that by 2030, China's share of global exports could rise to 16.5% from about 15% today, driven by strengths in advanced manufacturing and high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles, robotics, and batteries.\n\n\"Despite trade tensions, protectionism, and active industrial policies in G20 economies, we believe China will continue gaining share in the global goods export market,\" said Morgan Stanley Chief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya.",

      "body": "Beijing remains on course to hit its 5% growth target as advanced manufacturing drives long-term competitiveness.\n\nCustoms data released on Monday, December 8, showed that China's outbound goods rose 5.9 percent in November to $330.3 billion, an improvement on the 1.1 percent contraction recorded in October and stronger than economists had expected.\n\nThe uptick comes despite an ongoing slump in trade with the US, where Chinese exports fell nearly 29 percent from a year earlier in the eighth consecutive month of double-digit declines.\n\nBeijing's exporters have leaned increasingly on developing markets this year. Shipments to Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America have picked up, offering some relief as US demand weakens.\n\nAnalysts say this geographic rebalancing is becoming more pronounced, partly due to shifts in supply chains and growing demand for Chinese-manufactured goods in emerging economies.\n\nImports also improved, rising 1.9 percent in November compared with 1 percent in October. The increase suggests pockets of resilience in domestic demand even as China continues to grapple with a prolonged property downturn and subdued consumer spending.\n\nThe recent trade truce between Beijing and Washington, agreed during the October meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea, has provided some room for optimism.\n\nThe US moved to lower certain tariffs on Chinese goods while China committed to suspending export controls on rare earths. However, analysts caution that the benefits may be limited.\n\nING economists Lynn Song and Deepali Bhargava noted that China is now entering a period of unfavourable comparisons, reflecting strong export growth before Trump introduced substantial tariff hikes after returning to the White House.\n\nThey warned that the truce's impact may keep overall trade growth modest in the near term.\n\nFactory activity contracted again in November, marking eight consecutive months of decline. Economists argue it is too early to confirm whether external demand is undergoing a genuine recovery.\n\nEven so, Beijing appears on track to achieve its growth target of around 5 percent this year. Policy makers have already set advanced manufacturing as a priority for the next five-year plan, with more detailed strategies expected to emerge from an upcoming economic planning meeting.\n\nLooking ahead, some analysts believe China will continue expanding its global export footprint. Morgan Stanley expects China's share of global goods exports to reach 16.5 percent by 2030, up from about 15 percent today.\n\nChief Asia Economist Chetan Ahya said China's strength in electric vehicles, robotics, and battery technology will continue to give it an edge despite persistent global trade tensions.",

      "title": "China's Exports Rebound as Trade Shifts Away from the U.S.",
      "body": "China's exports rose far more than expected in November, climbing 5.9% year-on-year after a contraction the previous month. The rebound was driven almost entirely by stronger shipments to Europe, Africa and Latin America, as manufacturers pivot away from the U.S. market. Exports to the United States plunged 29% despite a recent agreement between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to ease some tariffs. Imports also grew modestly at 1.9%, below expectations.\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nThe data underscores a major structural shift in global trade: China is diversifying its export destinations to blunt the impact of Trump's aggressive tariffs. Economists say lost U.S. market access has already shaved about 2 percentage points off China's export growth, weighing on GDP. Despite November's rebound, Chinese factories remain under pressure, with broader manufacturing contracting for an eighth straight month. Uncertainty linger as export orders remain in decline, signalling fragile demand.\n\nWhat the Data Shows:\n\nChina's trade surplus widened sharply to $111.7 billion in November, up from $90.1 billion in October. Although exporters saw a temporary boost from front-loading shipments earlier this year, that strategy has now faded, making China more dependent on non-U.S. markets to sustain growth. Economists warn that even with diversification, weak global demand and tariff-driven disruptions will continue to constrain China's export engine.\n\nStakeholders & Global Impact:\n\nFor China, the shift opens new trade opportunities but also highlights the deep cost of reduced U.S. access. For Europe, Africa and Latin America, China's pivot means deeper economic ties and greater competition with local producers. For the U.S., the steep drop in Chinese imports reflects the effectiveness and economic distortions of the tariff campaign. Global supply chains remain unsettled as exporters and buyers adjust to a long-term recalibration in trade flows.\n\nWhat's Next:\n\nAnalysts expect China's export momentum to remain uneven as manufacturers search for alternative markets while navigating geopolitical tensions. Any further easing of U.S.-China trade restrictions could stabilize flows, but for now, Beijing appears committed to building resilience through broader global partnerships.",

      "body": "Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.\n\nChina's annual trade surplus has exceeded $1trn for the first time, as the manufacturing powerhouse shrugged off the impact of Donald Trump's trade war.\n\nNew trade data today shows that Chinese factories swelled their sales to non-US markets this year, making up from a sharp drop in shipments to the US.\n\nIn November, China's exports grew 5.9% year-on-year, customs data shows. That reverses a 1.1% contraction in October, and beats analyst forecasts.\n\nAnd for the first 11 months of the year, China's annual trade surplus (the difference between what it exported and imported), rose above the $1trn mark for the time (by my maths it was over $1.070tn).\n\nWhile exports to the US have slowed this year, due to the trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, China has turned to other market - such as Europe.\n\nLynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China, explains:\n\nNovember exports to the US were down -28.6% YoY, a three-month low, bringing the year-to-date growth to -18.9% YoY. It's likely that November exports have yet to fully reflect the tariff cut, which should feed through in the coming months.\n\nAlso, the frontloading effect as US importers ramped up purchases ahead of tariffs will act as a headwind on trade in the coming months. Instead of the US, the beat in November's data came from an acceleration of exports to the EU\n\nBy product, Song adds, familiar categories continued to see the strongest growth; Ships (26.8%), semiconductors (24.7%), and autos (16.7%).\n\nChina's rare earth exports jumped 26.5% month-on-month in November, Reuters reports - that's the first full month after Xi and Trump agreed to speed up shipment of the critical minerals from the world's largest refiner.\n\nSoybean imports are also poised for their best-ever year, as Chinese buyers, who had shunned US purchases for the majority of this year, stepped up purchases from American growers in addition to large purchases from Latin America.",

The growth reversed the previous month's unexpected 1.1% decline, which had been the first drop since March 2024.\n\nImports saw a 1.9% increase last month, falling short of the anticipated 3% growth.

      "body": "The milestone reached by China's surplus follows the recent de-escalation of tensions with the Trump administration\n\nChina's exports rebounded in November after an unexpected drop the previous month, pushing the trade surplus past a record $1 trillion.\n\nExports rose 5.9% from a year earlier, higher than the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists for 4%. Imports climbed only 1.9%, bringing the surplus for the month to $112 billion.\n\nThe milestone reached by China's surplus follows the recent de-escalation of tensions with the Trump administration and will draw scrutiny from trading partners that are having to contend with pressure on their domestic industries from a flood of cheaper goods. It also underscores how Beijing is struggling to rebalance the economy away from its dependence on demand abroad, with net exports accounting for almost a third of economic growth this year.\n\nShipments to the US plummeted 29% -- the eighth month of double-digit declines and the biggest since August. Strong growth in sales to regions like the European Union, Latin America and Africa more than offset the slump.\n\nLynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING Bank NV, said the rebounds in shipments to the EU and Japan were \"perhaps a little surprising.\"\n\n\"The November export data came in a little stronger than expected, despite a further deceleration of exports to the US,\" Song said.\n\nShipments overseas have boomed for much of this year, in spite of US President Donald Trump's launch of a trade war early in 2025. The world's second-biggest economy has emerged largely unscathed from the standoff, as it delivered more goods to markets other than the US.\n\nExports to the EU expanded almost 15% last month -- the fastest since July 2022 -- with sales to France, Germany and Italy all seeing double-digit growth. Shipments to Africa surged nearly 28%, while those to the 10-nation Southeast Asian trading bloc gained only 8.4%, the least since February.\n\nForeign demand has been the one consistent driver of Chinese growth, helping compensate for lackluster private consumption at home and the prolonged slump in the housing market.\n\nBut the trade picture has become increasingly unbalanced, with China's weak demand and increasingly innovative firms slashing demand for imports.\n\nThe historic trade surplus will help boost growth in gross domestic product after months of deterioration in the economy. Retail sales are coming off their longest stretch of slowdowns since 2021 while investment just shrank by a record amount.\n\nAlthough the Chinese economy is expanding at a slower pace in the last quarter of the year, its strong performance earlier in 2025 means the official growth target of around 5% is likely within reach.",

      "title": "China's Exports Bounce Back in Sign of Tariff Resilience  --  Update",
      "body": "China's exports rose more than expected last month, bouncing back even as shipments to the U.S. continued to fall.\n\nOutbound shipments rose 5.9% on the year in November, reversing October's 1.1% drop, government data showed Monday.\n\nThat roundly beat the 3.4% growth forecast in a Wall Street Journal poll, as demand for China's exports in key markets like the EU offset a deterioration in their performance in the U.S.\n\nThe trade truce struck between Washington and Beijing didn't help improve the performance of China's U.S.-bound exports in November, which fell 28.6% year-on-year, worsening from October's 25.2% drop.\n\nZichun Huang, an economist at Capital Economics, attributed that to reduced front-loading after the detente reached at the end of October lowered the risk of another jump in tariff rates.\n\nChina's shipments to the European Union, its second-largest trading partner, rose 14.8% on year in November, surging from the less than 1% increase recorded in October. Exports growth to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations slowed from October's 11.0% gain, but stayed relatively solid at 8.2%.\n\n\"The role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from U.S. tariffs still appears to be increasing,\" said Huang.\n\nNovember's trade data backs economists' view that China's exports will continue to show resilience in the year ahead.\n\nDespite trade tensions and increased protectionism, economists at Morgan Stanley expect China to widen its lead in manufacturing exports. They predict that the country's share of global goods exports will reach about 16.5% by 2030 from around 15% now.\n\nEconomies are trying to diversify away from China, but MS thinks it will hold its edge in advanced manufacturing. That's because of \"its ability to anticipate shifting global demand trends and its willingness to mobilize resources to build capacity to meet demand, even if ahead of time,\" the investment bank said in a note on Sunday.\n\nThanks to the robustness of exports, China's trade surplus has already surpassed last year's level and is expected to widen further next year, said Huang at Capital Economics.\n\nAccording to China's customs bureau, imports rose 1.9% from a year earlier in November, compared with October's 1.0% increase. That resulted in a trade surplus of $111.68 billion, up from $90.07 billion the prior month, and higher than the $102.5 billion expected in the WSJ poll.\n\nTrade strength bodes well for the broader economy, which seems to be on track to hit the official 5% growth target for this year, said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\n\nWhile economic momentum has slowed in the final quarter, weighed down by the continued slump in the property market, the exports rebound should help mitigate weak domestic demand, he said in a note.\n\nUpbeat trade data could take some pressure off policymakers to deliver stimulus.\n\nLater this month, Chinese leaders will gather to set the economic priorities for next year.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs expect policymakers to express greater concern about growth challenges, especially from the real-estate sector, \"and to emphasize easing measures aimed at boosting domestic demand and stabilizing growth.\"\n\nWrite to Singapore editors at singaporeeditors@dowjones.com",

      "body": "hina's exports topped forecasts in November, driven by a surge in shipments to non-US markets as manufacturers deepen trade ties with the rest of the world in light of President Donald Trump's prohibitively high tariffs.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy has ramped up efforts to diversify its export markets since Trump won last November's presidential election, pursuing closer trade ties with Southeast Asia and the European Union, and leveraging Chinese firms' global footprint to establish new production hubs for low-tariff access.\n\nChina's exports grew 5.9 percent year-on-year, customs data showed on Monday, reversing from a 1.1 percent contraction a month prior, and beating a 3.8 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nImports were up 1.9 percent, compared to a 1.0 percent uptick in October. Economists had expected a 3.0 percent increase.\n\n\"The tariff cuts agreed under the US-China trade truce didn't help to lift shipments to the US last month, but overall export growth rebounded nonetheless,\" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. \"We expect China's exports will remain resilient, with the country continuing to gain global market share next year.\"\n\n\"The role of trade rerouting in offsetting the drag from US tariffs still appears to be increasing,\" she added.\n\nThe average US tariff on Chinese goods stands at 47.5 percent, well above the 40 percent threshold that economists say erodes Chinese exporters' profit margins.\n\nChinese shipments to the US dropped 29 percent in November year-on-year, the data shows, even though the month began with news that the United States and China had agreed to scale back some of their tariffs and a raft of other measures after Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea on Oct. 30.\n\nExports to the European Union grew an annual 14.8 percent last month, while shipments to Australia surged 35.8 percent, and the fast-growing Southeast Asian economies took in 8.2 percent more goods over the same period.\n\nThat boosted China's trade surplus to $111.68 billion in November, the highest since June, from $90.07 billion recorded the previous month, and above a forecast of $100.2 billion.\n\nThe trade surplus for the 11 months of the year topped $1 trillion for the first time.\n\n\"Electronic machinery and semiconductors seem to be key,\" said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group. \"There is a shortage in lower-grade chips and other electronics, which meant prices jumped, and Chinese companies going global have been importing all kinds of machinery and other inputs from China.\"\n\nChina's yuan firmed on Monday, off the back of the stronger-than-expected export data, with investors also awaiting policy signals from key year-end meetings.\n\nThe Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged on Monday to take steps to expand domestic demand, a shift analysts say is crucial for weaning the $19 trillion economy away from reliance on exports.\n\nTop officials are also expected to convene for the annual Central Economic Work Conference in the coming days to set key targets and outline policy priorities for next year.\n\nEconomists estimate that diminished access to the US market since Trump returned to the White House has reduced China's export growth by roughly 2 percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3 percent of GDP.\n\nOctober's unexpected downturn, following an 8.3 percent surge the month prior, signaled that Chinese exporters' tactic of front-loading US-bound shipments to beat Trump's tariffs had run its course.\n\nAlthough Chinese factory owners reported an improvement in new export orders in November, they were still in contraction, underscoring continued uncertainty for manufacturers as they struggle to replace demand in the absence of US buyers.\n\nAn official survey tracking broader factory activity showed that the sector contracted for an eighth consecutive month.\n\nChina's rare earth exports jumped 26.5 percent month-on-month in November, the first full month after Xi and Trump agreed to speed up shipment of the critical minerals from the world's largest refiner.\n\nThe nation's soybean imports are also poised for their best-ever year, as Chinese buyers, who had shunned US purchases for the majority of this year, stepped up purchases from American growers in addition to large purchases from Latin America.\n\nOverall, China's domestic demand remains soft due to a prolonged property downturn.\n\nThat weakness was seen in a decline in imports of unwrought copper, a key material in construction and manufacturing.\n\n\"China's pivot to establishing domestic demand as a key driver of growth will take time, but it's essential for China to move into the next phase in its economic development,\" said Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for Greater China.",

      "body": "In a recent report, Goldman Sachs upgraded China's expected GDP growth for 2025 from 4.9 percent to 5 percent, while also projecting stronger performance in the years ahead. The firm anticipates that China's exports will grow significantly faster than previously estimated, driven by increasing global demand for Chinese products and improving competitiveness across industries.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) echoed this optimism, raising its own 2025 growth projection for China to 5 percent. The OECD highlighted China's proactive fiscal measures, including steps to boost household consumption and upgrade major sectors such as automobiles and home appliances, as important contributors to economic resilience.\n\nFinancial institutions around the world point to China's strong policy toolkit as another factor supporting the positive outlook. Analysts at Deutsche Bank noted that Beijing's expanded fiscal initiatives -- including a new 500-billion-yuan policy-based financial instrument -- are set to fuel domestic demand through late 2025 and early 2026. A recent Morgan Stanley assessment similarly predicts steady growth next year, supported by targeted policy easing and gradual structural rebalancing.\n\nChinese financial experts have also voiced their confidence. Economists at Everbright Securities emphasized the advantages of China's vast domestic market and robust industrial supply chain, while analysts at China International Capital Corporation observed continued improvements in foreign-trade composition and competitiveness. New consumption trends -- such as lifestyle-driven products and rising domestic brands -- are also emerging as important growth engines.\n\nGlobal companies appear to share the upbeat sentiment.

      "body": "BEIJING: China's exports topped forecasts in November, driven by a surge in shipments to non-U.S. markets as manufacturers deepen trade ties with the rest of the world in light of President Donald Trump's prohibitively high tariffs.\n\nOutbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy grew 5.9% year-on-year, customs data showed on Monday, reversing from a 1.1% contraction a month prior, and beating a 3.8% forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nImports were up 1.9%, compared to a 1.0% uptick in October. Economists had expected a 3.0% increase.\n\n\"There's no improvement in China's direct exports to the U.S.. Exports to the European Union, Africa and Latin America outperformed instead,\" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nChinese shipments to the U.S. dropped 29% in November year-on-year, the data shows, even though the month began with news that the United States and China had agreed to scale back some of their tariffs and a raft of other measures after Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea on October 30.\n\nEconomists estimate that diminished access to the U.S. market has reduced China's export growth by roughly 2 percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3% of GDP.\n\nOctober's unexpected downturn, following an 8.3% surge the month prior, signalled that Chinese exporters' tactic of front-loading U.S.-bound shipments to beat Trump's tariffs had run its course.\n\nAlthough Chinese factory owners reported an improvement in new export orders in November, they were still in contraction, underscoring continued uncertainty for manufacturers as they struggle to replace demand in the absence of U.S. buyers.\n\nAn official survey tracking broader factory activity showed that the sector contracted for an eighth consecutive month.\n\nChina's trade surplus stood at $111.68 billion in November, from $90.07 billion recorded the previous month, and beating a forecast of $100.2 billion. - Reuters",

      "title": "China's trade surplus climbs past $1 trillion for first time",
      "body": "China got the world's attention in January when it announced that its trade surplus for goods and services had hit almost $1 trillion, an excess of exports to imports that no country had ever reached.\n\nNow China has surged through that milestone in just 11 months this year. China's customs agency announced Monday that the country's accumulated trade surplus reached $1.08 trillion through November.\n\nTariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on China have caused Chinese exports to the United States to drop by nearly a fifth. But China has throttled back its purchases of American soybeans and other products by almost the same rate, continuing to sell three times as much to the United States as it buys.\n\nChina's $111.68 billion trade surplus in November was its third-largest in a single month. The overall surplus through the first 11 months of the year is up 21.7% from the same period last year.\n\nChina has ramped up considerably its sales to other countries. From cars to solar panels to consumer electronics, a tsunami of Chinese exports is flooding Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. Carmakers and other exporters in traditional manufacturing powerhouses like Germany, Japan and South Korea are losing customers to Chinese rivals. Factories in developing countries like Indonesia and South Africa have had to curtail production or even close as they struggle to match China's low prices.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nChinese companies have shifted final assembly of their goods to Southeast Asia, Mexico and Africa, which then ship finished products to the United States. This has allowed them to partly bypass Trump's tariffs on goods coming straight from China.\n\nChina now sells more than twice as much to the European Union as it buys. China's trade surplus with the region has widened considerably this year.\n\nOne major reason is that China's currency has been weak over the past several years against many other currencies, particularly the euro. Another is that prices have been falling in China, while they have been rising in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe weakness of the Chinese currency, the yuan (also known as renminbi), has helped propel its exports. More than a tenth of the Chinese economy now consists of its trade surplus in manufactured goods. Europe has felt the sting sharply.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\"With the renminbi undervalued by 30% against the euro, possibly more, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to compete against Chinese manufacturers even if Europe does all the right things it needs to do in terms of deregulation, bringing down energy prices and establishing a true unified market,\" said Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nChina's trade surplus in factory goods is even bigger as a share of its economy than the United States ran in the years immediately after World War II, when most other manufacturing nations were in ruins; or during the early years of World War I, when the United States was at peace and churning out civilian goods while Europe was embroiled in war.\n\nTop leaders of the International Monetary Fund, which monitors economies with the aim of preventing crises, are making their annual visit to China this week to review its currency and financial policies and are expected to announce a preliminary summary of their findings Wednesday.\n\nA growing number of economists and business leaders, including former senior officials at China's own central bank, are calling on Beijing to let the yuan increase in value against the dollar and other currencies.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nFor China, a stronger yuan would make goods like gasoline, French wines or Japanese cosmetics cheaper to import. Savings on such purchases would leave China's households with more money to spend on Chinese goods and services, like restaurant meals, concert tickets and electric cars.\n\nReviving consumer spending in China is one of the top goals of Beijing leaders. But doing so by allowing the yuan to strengthen would also carry costs for China.\n\nA stronger yuan would hurt China's exporters. The dollars they earn by selling goods in foreign markets would yield fewer yuan for them to pay workers and other expenses. Factories create millions of jobs in China, and a stronger yuan could slow the rate at which other countries transfer manufacturing to China.\n\nChina's export success has also financed a boom in technological innovation and has given Beijing the resources to help other authoritarian countries when they encounter difficulties, notably Russia, North Korea and Iran.\n\nMost Read\n\n1Known for 'internationalisation' of IndiGo, its CEO for 3 years Pieter Elbers gets show cause notice\n\n2Sebi impounds Rs 546 crore from Avadhut Sathe; bars the finfluencer from securities market amid crackdown\n\n3DGCA allows IndiGo CEO Elbers, COO Porqueras one-time 24-hour extension to respond to show-cause notices on flight disruptions\n\n4US negotiators in Delhi next\n\nweek, kindle hopes of deal before December-end\n\n5'Those responsible for IndiGo flight cancellations will pay': Aviation Minister as Centre launches probe\n\n6Question mark over role of IndiGo high-profile board, its risk committee in run-up to crisis\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nChina is trying to preserve its trade surplus by pressing other countries not to erect trade barriers. \"Protectionism cannot solve the problems caused by global industrial restructuring, but will only worsen the international environment for trade,\" Xi Jinping, China's top leader, said Thursday, according to a Chinese government summary of his meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France.\n\nSome Chinese economists nonetheless say that China must someday accept a narrower trade surplus to help its long-suffering consumers.\n\n\"For China to expand domestic demand, it is necessary to minimize the trade surplus, and in the future it may even need to consider maintaining a trade deficit,\" Zhang Jun, dean of the School of Economics at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in a speech last month.",

      "title": "China's Exports Rebound, Cumulative Trade Surplus Surpasses $1 Trillion",
      "body": "China's exports rebounded last month, surpassing a cumulative trade surplus of 1 trillion dollars. Although China's exports had significantly declined as it exchanged retaliatory measures with the U.S. until just before the U.S.-China summit on October 30 of last month, the relevant indicators improved in November after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to refrain from escalating tensions during the summit.\n\nAccording to the General Administration of Customs of China on the morning of the 8th (local time), November exports increased by 5.9% compared to the same period last year. This marked a significant improvement from the 1.1% decrease in October and exceeded market expectations of a 3.8-4% increase compiled by Reuters and Bloomberg.\n\nImports grew by only 1.9%. While this was an increase from the previous month's 1% growth, it fell short of market expectations of a 2.5-3% increase. This month's trade surplus reached 111.68 billion dollars (approximately 164 trillion won), a 24% increase from the previous month's surplus of 90.07 billion dollars (approximately 132 trillion won).\n\nOn a cumulative basis from January to November, exports increased by 5.4% compared to the same period last year, while imports decreased by 0.6%. The cumulative trade surplus reached 1.076 trillion dollars (approximately 1,582 trillion won), a 21.6% increase.\n\nZhang Ziwei, chief economist at Pingpoint Asset Management, told the South China Morning Post (SCMP) in Hong Kong, \"The rebound in November exports will help alleviate domestic demand sluggishness,\" adding, \"China is expected to achieve this year's government target of 'around 5% growth.' The policy direction for 2026 is expected to be concretized through the upcoming Politburo meeting and Central Economic Work Conference.\"\n\nForeign media analyzed that the U.S.-China summit held in Busan on October 30 of last month and the leaders' phone call in November served as catalysts for the export recovery, and that China's export diversification strategy also proved effective.\n\nU.S. CNBC reported, \"Since the ceasefire, the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese goods has remained at approximately 47.5%, while China's tariff rate on U.S. goods stands at around 32%.\" It added, \"Following the summit and trade agreements between the world's two largest economies, manufacturers rushed to ship inventory to seize the opportunity for easing tensions, leading to the recovery of Chinese exports. Although the yuan has been appreciating in recent weeks, China's export flow does not appear to have slowed significantly.\"\n\nHowever, exports to the U.S. continued to plummet. In November, China's exports to the U.S. decreased by 28.6%, marking the largest decline since August and extending the double-digit decrease for eight consecutive months. Instead, exports to regions such as the European Union (EU), Africa, and Central and South America surged, filling the gap. According to Bloomberg, exports to the EU increased by nearly 15%, the largest growth since July 2022, while exports to Africa jumped by approximately 28%. Lin Song, senior economist at ING Bank, told Bloomberg, \"The rebound in exports to the EU and Japan was somewhat surprising.\"",

      "title": "China's trade surplus tops US$1 trillion after exports rebound",
      "body": "[BEIJING] China's exports rebounded in November after an unexpected drop the previous month, pushing the trade surplus past a record US$1 trillion.\n\nExports rose 5.9 per cent from a year earlier, higher than the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists for 4 per cent. Imports climbed only 1.9 per cent, bringing the surplus for the month to US$112 billion.\n\nThe milestone reached by China's surplus follows the recent de-escalation of tensions with the Trump administration and will draw scrutiny from trading partners that are having to contend with pressure on their domestic industries from a flood of cheaper goods. It also underscores how Beijing is struggling to rebalance the economy away from its dependence on demand abroad, with net exports accounting for almost a third of economic growth this year.\n\nShipments to the US plummeted 29 per cent, the eighth month of double-digit declines and the biggest since August. Strong growth in sales to regions such as the European Union, Latin America and Africa more than offset the slump.\n\nLynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING Bank, said the rebounds in shipments to the EU and Japan were \"perhaps a little surprising\".\n\n\"The November export data came in a little stronger than expected, despite a further deceleration of exports to the US,\" Song said.\n\nShipments overseas have boomed for much of this year, in spite of US President Donald Trump's launch of a trade war early in 2025. The world's second-biggest economy has emerged largely unscathed from the standoff, as it delivered more goods to markets other than the US.\n\nExports to the EU expanded almost 15 per cent last month, the fastest since July 2022, with sales to France, Germany and Italy all seeing double-digit growth. Shipments to Africa surged nearly 28 per cent, while those to the 10-nation South-east Asian trading bloc gained only 8.4 per cent, the least since February.\n\nForeign demand has been the one consistent driver of Chinese growth, helping compensate for lacklustre private consumption at home and the prolonged slump in the housing market.\n\nBut the trade picture has become increasingly unbalanced, with China's weak demand and increasingly innovative firms slashing demand for imports.\n\nThe historic trade surplus will help boost growth in gross domestic product after months of deterioration in the economy. Retail sales are coming off their longest stretch of slowdowns since 2021, while investment just shrank by a record amount.\n\nAlthough the Chinese economy is expanding at a slower pace in the last quarter of the year, its strong performance earlier in 2025 means the official growth target of around 5 per cent is likely within reach.

      "body": "China's exports have topped forecasts in November, driven by a surge in shipments to non-US markets as manufacturers deepen trade ties with the rest of the world in light of President Donald Trump's prohibitively high tariffs.\n\nOutbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy grew 5.9 per cent year-on-year, customs data showed on Monday, reversing from a 1.1 per cent contraction a month prior, and beating a 3.8 per cent forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nImports were up 1.9 per cent, compared to a 1.0 per cent uptick in October. Economists had expected a 3.0 per cent increase.\n\n\"There's no improvement in China's direct exports to the US. Exports to the European Union, Africa and Latin America outperformed instead,\" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nChinese shipments to the US dropped 29 per cent in November year-on-year, the data shows, even though the month began with news that the US and China had agreed to scale back some of their tariffs and a raft of other measures after Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met in South Korea on October 30.\n\nEconomists estimate that diminished access to the US market has reduced China's export growth by roughly two percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3 per cent of GDP.\n\nOctober's unexpected downturn, following an 8.3 per cent surge the month prior, signalled that Chinese exporters' tactic of front-loading US-bound shipments to beat Trump's tariffs had run its course.\n\nAlthough Chinese factory owners reported an improvement in new export orders in November, they were still in contraction, underscoring continued uncertainty for manufacturers as they struggle to replace demand in the absence of US buyers.\n\nAn official survey tracking broader factory activity showed that the sector contracted for an eighth consecutive month.\n\nChina's trade surplus stood at $US111.68 billion ($A168 billion) in November, from $US90.07 billion ($A135 billion) recorded the previous month, and beating a forecast of $100.2 billion.",

      "body": "Join the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\n\nChina's yuan picked up momentum after exports rose 5.9% in November, blowing past expectations and handing the country an upbeat economic headline.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nChina's export rebound not only reversed the previous month's decline, but also came in more than two percentage points stronger than analysts expected -- a welcome surprise for investors tracking the world's second-largest economy. At the same time, the People's Bank of China has held its daily midpoint for the yuan steady for eight sessions in a row, narrowing the gap with market estimates to just 17 pips from 180 last week. Experts at Maybank say this steady hand is helping curb currency swings and anchor local market sentiment during an uncertain backdrop. Easing frictions between the US and China are also offering some breathing room, reassuring traders and investors as China gears up for crucial economy-focused government meetings.\n\nChina's export surprise helped strengthen the yuan against the dollar, with both onshore and offshore rates nudging up above 7.07 per dollar. The dollar index edged down to a multi-month low, pointing to subtle changes in global currency flows. Investors are now watching to see if China's momentum can last, particularly with upcoming policy meetings expected to lay out plans for tackling weak domestic demand and ongoing property sector challenges.\n\nThe bigger picture: Trade strength shapes global growth signals.\n\nChina's better-than-expected exports and a firmer yuan send a signal that the country could hold steady as a key force in global trade, especially if policymakers ramp up support in 2025. With Goldman Sachs forecasting more aggressive easing to boost housing and spending, and a thaw in US-China relations, the stage is set for China's next moves to influence global markets well into next year.",

      "body": "BEIJING - China's exports rebounded in November after an unexpected drop the previous month, pushing the trade surplus past US$1 trillion (S$1.3 trillion) for the first time in any year.\n\nExports rose 5.9 per cent from a year earlier, higher than the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists for 4 per cent. Imports climbed only 1.9 per cent, bringing the surplus for the month to US$112 billion.\n\nThe milestone reached by China's surplus follows the recent de-escalation of tensions with the Trump administration and will draw scrutiny from trading partners that are having to contend with pressure on their domestic industries from a flood of cheaper goods.\n\nIt also underscores how Beijing is struggling to rebalance the economy away from its dependence on demand abroad, with net exports accounting for almost a third of economic growth in 2025.\n\nShipments overseas have boomed for much of 2025, in spite of US President Donald Trump's launch of a trade war early in 2025. The world's second-biggest economy has emerged largely unscathed from the standoff, as it delivered more goods to markets other than the United States.\n\nForeign demand has been the one consistent driver of Chinese growth, helping compensate for lackluster private consumption at home and the prolonged slump in the housing market.\n\nBut the trade picture has become increasingly unbalanced, with China's weak demand and increasingly innovative firms slashing demand for imports.\n\nThe historic trade surplus will help boost growth in gross domestic product after months of deterioration in the economy. Retail sales are coming off their longest stretch of slowdowns since 2021 while investment just shrank by a record amount.\n\nAlthough the Chinese economy is expanding at a slower pace in the last quarter of 2025, its strong performance earlier in the year means the official growth target of around 5 per cent is likely within reach.

      "body": "China's exports increased 5.9% in November, surpassing expectations despite U.S. tariffs. This growth, driven by higher shipments to non-U.S. markets, highlights China's strengthening trade ties globally. Imports also rose modestly. However, exports to the U.S. dropped 29%, indicating the impact of reduced access to this crucial market.\n\nChina's export performance in November defied predictions, as shipments grew by 5.9% compared to the previous year, significantly outpacing the 3.8% rise anticipated by analysts. This uptick was fueled by increased trade with markets outside the U.S., as American tariffs continue to challenge Chinese manufacturers.\n\nImport activity showed modest improvement, with a 1.9% rise against October's 1.0% gain, though still short of the 3.0% forecast by economists. \"We've seen no progress in China's direct exports to the U.S.,\" commented Economist Intelligence Unit's Xu Tianchen, noting stronger performance in European, African, and Latin American markets.\n\nNovember's data reveals a notable 29% drop in shipments to the U.S. year-on-year, despite trade talks between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. Analysts estimate that the reduction in U.S. market access clipped China's export growth by about 2 percentage points, impacting GDP by approximately 0.3%.",

      "title": "China's Trade Surplus Climbs Past $1 Trillion for First Time",
      "body": "China got the world's attention last January when it announced that its trade surplus for goods and services had hit almost $1 trillion, an excess of exports to imports that no country had ever reached.\n\nNow China has surged through that milestone in just 11 months this year. China's customs agency announced on Monday that the country's accumulated trade surplus reached $1.08 trillion through November.\n\nTariffs imposed by President Trump on China have caused Chinese exports to the United States to drop by nearly a fifth. But China has throttled back its purchases of American soybeans and other products by almost the same rate, continuing to sell three times as much to the United States as it buys.\n\nChina's $111.68 billion trade surplus in November was its third-largest ever in a single month. The overall surplus through the first 11 months of the year is up 21.7 percent from the same period last year.\n\nChina has ramped up considerably its sales to other countries. From cars to solar panels to consumer electronics, a tsunami of Chinese exports is flooding Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. Carmakers and other exporters in traditional manufacturing powerhouses like Germany, Japan and South Korea are losing customers to Chinese rivals. Factories in developing countries like Indonesia and South Africa have had to curtail production or even close as they struggle to match China's low prices.\n\nChinese companies have shifted final assembly of their goods to Southeast Asia, Mexico and Africa, which then ship finished products to the United States. This has allowed them to partly bypass Mr. Trump's tariffs on goods coming straight from China.\n\nChina now sells more than twice as much to the European Union as it buys. China's trade surplus with the region has widened considerably this year.\n\nOne major reason is that China's currency has been weak over the last several years against many other currencies, particularly the euro. Another is that prices have been falling in China, while they have been rising in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe weakness of the Chinese currency, the renminbi, has helped propel its exports. More than a tenth of the Chinese economy now consists of its trade surplus in manufactured goods. Europe has felt the sting sharply.\n\n\"With the renminbi undervalued by 30 percent against the euro, possibly more, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to compete against Chinese manufacturers even if Europe does all the right things it needs to do in terms of deregulation, bringing down energy prices and establishing a true unified market,\" said Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nChina's trade surplus in factory goods is even bigger as a share of its economy than the United States ran in the years immediately after World War II, when most other manufacturing nations were in ruins; or during the early years of World War I, when the United States was at peace and churning out civilian goods while Europe was embroiled in war.\n\nTop leaders of the International Monetary Fund, which monitors economies with the aim of preventing crises, are making their annual visit to China this week to review its currency and financial policies and are expected to announce a preliminary summary of their findings on Wednesday.\n\nA growing number of economists and business leaders, including former senior officials at China's own central bank, are calling on Beijing to let the renminbi increase in value against the dollar and other currencies.\n\nFor China, a stronger renminbi would make goods like gasoline, French wines or Japanese cosmetics cheaper to import. Savings on such purchases would leave China's households with more money to spend on Chinese goods and services, like restaurant meals, concert tickets and electric cars.\n\nReviving consumer spending in China is one of the top goals of Beijing leaders. But doing so by allowing the renminbi to strengthen would also carry costs for China.\n\nA stronger renminbi would hurt China's exporters. The dollars they earn by selling goods in foreign markets would yield fewer renminbi for them to pay workers and other expenses. Factories create millions of jobs in China, and a stronger renminbi could slow the rate at which other countries transfer manufacturing to China.\n\nChina's export success has also financed a boom in technological innovation and has given Beijing the resources to help other authoritarian countries when they encounter difficulties, notably Russia, North Korea and Iran.\n\nChina is trying to preserve its trade surplus by pressing other countries not to erect trade barriers. \"Protectionism cannot solve the problems caused by global industrial restructuring, but will only worsen the international environment for trade,\" Xi Jinping, China's top leader, said on Thursday, according to a Chinese government summary of his meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France.\n\nSome Chinese economists nonetheless say that China must someday accept a narrower trade surplus to help its long-suffering consumers.\n\n\"For China to expand domestic demand, it is necessary to minimize the trade surplus, and in the future it may even need to consider maintaining a trade deficit,\" Zhang Jun, dean of the School of Economics at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in a speech last month.",

      "title": "Asia 2026: 10 questions for China's year ahead",
      "body": "Will China be able to manage another year of stable growth?\n\nWe are looking for a slight slowdown in Chinese growth to around 4.6% year-on-year in 2026, which, in our interpretation, qualifies as another year of stable growth.\n\nChina looks likely to achieve another year of \"around 5%\" GDP growth in 2025, as a strong start to the year - driven by resilient external demand and a boost to consumption from the trade-in policy - should be a sufficient buffer against slowing growth in the second half of the year.\n\nPremier Li Qiang revealed that the Chinese government aims to reach a GDP of RMB170tr by 2030, which will require growth of around 4-5% in the coming years. To get off to a strong start, we believe that China could once again target growth of \"around 5%\" in 2026 for a fourth consecutive year. The odds of the goal being softened to \"above 4.5%\" are increasing, though China has not held the same growth target for more than three consecutive years since 2011.\n\nFrom where the economy currently stands, this doesn't look to be a simple task. Fixed-asset investment has slumped to negative levels for the first time since the lockdown impacted the year of 2020. Consumption has shown signs of slowing as the impact of the trade-in policy gradually shifts from a tailwind to a headwind. All of this is translating into a contraction in new renminbi loans.\n\nThe overarching problem is that domestic confidence indicators remain weak. This is likely tied to the continued downturn in the property market, as well as years of cost-cutting that led to wage cuts and layoffs. Stimulus might prove less potent without addressing these core issues.\n\nExternal demand has been a notable driver of growth in the past two years. It's uncertain whether momentum can be sustained for a third year straight. If this engine begins to slow, the outlook will become considerably more difficult. This would be one of the biggest downside risks to the scenario.\n\nChina's policy execution and its timing present major uncertainty to the outlook as well. While stronger early growth may have reduced the urgency for new stimulus in the fourth quarter, a broad-based slowdown of growth would signal that more support may be needed in 2026. What this ends up looking like, and the timing, will play a big role in shaping the growth trajectory.\n\nUpside risks in our view could come from developments in key tech races, including AI+ products, robotics, and biotech. China's strategy for the next five years will be concentrated on industrial modernisation and technological development to move up the value-added ladder. A tech breakthrough that generates a new wave of demand could be a notable growth driver for years to come.\n\nCan China's trade resilience last?\n\nOur base case is a slight moderation in external demand in 2026. But one of the main risks is a worse-than-expected deterioration in the external demand outlook. China's exports have been a relative outperformer for the last two years. Industrial activity has also seen solid growth to service this external demand.\n\nThe big surprise of 2025 was the resilience of Chinese exports despite the outbreak of Trade War 2.0 with the US. Recall this time last year. Many analysts had been forecasting a sharp slowdown in China's GDP, with the more bearish forecasters factoring in a drag of 2-3ppt to growth. Instead, through the first 10 months of the year, China's exports grew 5.3% year-on-year, and its trade surplus rose 22.1% to $964.8bn.\n\nOne initial reaction might be to assume that tariffs have had a limited impact. This would be a mistake. Exports to the US are down 17.7% YoY, year-to-date, through October 2025, and the contraction looks likely to deepen as the year closes out. Export categories that rely heavily on the US, such as furniture, footwear, and toys, all saw exports contract.\n\nChina's export resilience can be credited to two main factors. First, exports have been diversified successfully to other regions, with ASEAN (14.5%), the EU (7.7%), India (13.3%), and Africa (26.2%) all showing solid growth. Second, China's fastest-growing exports, such as electric vehicles, lithium batteries, semiconductors, and ships, have very limited US exposure.\n\nWill this resilience last? It's not certain that external demand will hold up. Our ING forecasts generally show slightly slower growth in key economies next year. Absent any new catalysts, this backdrop could translate to slower demand growth for Chinese exports. Recent flare-ups with Japan and the Netherlands are a reminder that the external environment can be quite unpredictable.\n\nOn China's trade with the US, markets breathed a sigh of relief after a one-year truce was agreed when Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump met in South Korea. However, it should be noted that the tariffs on China, currently at around 47%, remain well above the 20.7% level before Trump's inauguration. Combined with the front-loading of trade seen in the first quarter, it's likely that exports to the US will remain under pressure at least until the second quarter of 2026.\n\nThough the agreement is for a year, it should be noted that there's no guarantee this uneasy truce will last that long. A lot needs to go right for the agreement to hold for the full year. While there's the potential for a rebound of exports to the US next year, it's far from guaranteed. One miscalculation and we could easily see a re-escalation of tariffs and tensions.\n\nTrade remains difficult to forecast even in calmer waters, but at this juncture, it seems prudent to expect a softer external demand backdrop for next year.\n\nCan domestic demand pick up the slack?\n\nChina has often invoked the idea of a \"dual circulation strategy,\" in which growth is driven by two \"loops\" - an external one tied to global trade and investment, and an internal one driven by domestic demand and self-sufficiency in key technologies.\n\nWe've seen the external loop do much of the heavy lifting in the last few years. However, the internal loop has shown mixed results as of late, with consumption recovering in 2025 but investment declining.\n\nIf our view of a less supportive external demand environment materialises, China's growth outlook will require the internal loop, namely domestic demand, to pick up the slack. The ability to do so will likely hinge on what policy initiatives China uses to support domestic demand.\n\nConsumption has benefited over the past few years from China's trade-in policy, a de facto subsidy for specific consumer products. Beneficiary categories have included autos, household appliances, consumer electronics, and furniture, and these categories saw major outperformance in their respective policy windows.\n\nHowever, the trade-in policy essentially front-loads consumption and has limited lasting power. The logic is simple. While households may choose to buy a new car or washing machine when it comes with a nice discount, they likely won't immediately buy another one next year, even if the discount remains. As we have seen with automobiles, after a surge in sales during the early stages of the trade-in policy, sales flatlined in subsequent years. This pattern appears to be repeating with household appliance sales in this year's fourth quarter, and the same could occur in consumer electronics and furniture in 2026.\n\nThis means either expanding the trade-in policy to other categories or adopting a new policy to support consumption next year. Given the increased focus on services, expanding consumption vouchers for the services sector could be considered. Other moves, such as adjusting tax brackets, are possible but may be difficult to implement amid fiscal pressures.\n\nOn the investment side, while a recovery is possible as sidelined corporates resume new investments, we don't yet see signs of a major turnaround coming in 2026. China's 'anti-involution' policy to combat extreme price competition, along with comments from the 15th Five-Year Plan, suggest that cutting down on redundant investment will be a priority. The same goes for recalibrating incentives to align with a national, rather than a regional-focused, development strategy. These are positive steps that could well reduce overcapacity and improve the efficiency of future investment. But they will likely result in short-term headwinds amid stricter investment approval processes and greater caution in how funds are spent.\n\nThe core issue holding back domestic demand, in our view, is increasingly entrenched pessimism across households and the private sector. Chinese households have one of the highest savings rates globally. Convincing them that it is okay to lower these savings will be a tall task.\n\nMost confidence indicators have been grinding a little higher over the past year, but remain much closer to the historical low than to the historical mean. Our view is that for confidence to recover, we need to see a stable, if not positive, wealth effect. This hinges in large part on the recovery of the housing market. We also need to see an exit from the cost-cutting environment that has set in in the workplace. Both of these are much easier said than done. In the meantime, policies to boost short-term consumption may be needed to keep growth afloat.\n\nCan China finally put the brakes on the property decline?\n\nWe were much more optimistic about the property market this time last year, when policymakers were regularly lifting purchase restrictions and rolling out policies to support it. This optimism proved to be misplaced. Policy support slowed in 2025, and we've seen a concerning re-acceleration of falling property prices. In October, China's 70-city property prices saw secondary-market prices fall by more than 20% from the peak.\n\nRecent signals haven't been encouraging either. Former Minister of Finance Lou Jiwei stated that the property slump will continue and could hinder growth for another five years. It doesn't sound like a panacea is around the corner, with policy signalling suggesting that avoiding major systemic risks is enough. With property developer defaults slowing for another year, the bright side would be that systemic risks indeed look limited.\n\nAs such, a V or U-shaped recovery is looking quite improbable. An L-shaped recovery establishing a trough might be a more realistic bull case for 2026. That said, the importance of property to domestic confidence cannot be overstated. There will still be pressure to step in if the downturn worsens. For now, market reports indicate that policymakers are considering mortgage subsidies for new homebuyers, raising tax rebates for property purchases, and lowering home transaction fees. We expect that, in addition to these proposals, further support is needed to remove the remaining purchase restrictions and ramp up government purchases of unsold homes.\n\nThe bear case is that officials simply let the downturn play out. While a new market equilibrium would eventually be reached through market forces alone, it could take an extended period at the cost of significant wealth destruction and more entrenched deflationary expectations. This would have significant implications for China's longer-term economic transition, notably by hindering efforts to strengthen domestic demand.\n\nPrice trajectory aside, housing inventory remains highly elevated. Until inventories normalise, it will be difficult to expect a turnaround in real estate investment. As such, even though the base effect is weak, another year of contracting property investment growth looks likely.\n\nAt the least, a true property turnaround doesn't look likely to be a 2026 story, barring a major change of heart from policymakers. Property will likely remain one of the biggest drags on the economy next year.\n\nWill China's tech 'gold rush' lead to riches or ruin?\n\nPolicymakers have heavily leaned into tech and innovation as part of the national development strategy. Tech was the top priority for China in the 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP), and remains a prominent part of China's growth strategy in the 15th FYP.\n\nIncreased sanctions targeting Chinese companies have strengthened the tech self-reliance drive, spurring the creation of domestic champions. Once seen as a one-horse race in which the US was preordained to win the AI race, China's breakthroughs this year prompted some to reevaluate.\n\nChina's tech push has had numerous real-world implications:\n\n* China's fastest-growing trade categories are often tech-related. In the first 10 months of the year, hi-tech imports rose by 14.1% YoY to $79.5bn, while hi-tech exports rose 6.8% to $684bn. Prior investment in EVs has made China not only the world's largest producer and exporter of EVs, but also its largest consumer.\n\n* Many tech-related sectors have been attracting the most investment in recent years, and growth has remained solid despite the overall weak investment environment. Aside from the EV, battery, and semiconductor industries, which we often discuss, China's grid investments in power data centres have also risen 10% YoY YTD in a year of otherwise soft investment.\n\n* The tech race has increased the need for China to improve its domestic semiconductor industry. This has translated into a 35.3% YoY YTD uptick in semiconductor manufacturing equipment imports through 3Q25, while direct semiconductor imports have risen only 8.8% YoY YTD. The recent buildup of China's domestic industry has also made semiconductor exports one of its fastest-growing categories, up 23.4% YoY through 10 months of 2025.\n\n* China's tech sector has outperformed equities amid the rally of the past year. At the time of writing, the Hang Seng Composite Index's IT subindex is up 51.9% on a 12-month basis, outperforming the HSCI's 37.2% return over the same period.\n\nThere have been numerous positive developments in China's hi-tech sector. In addition to the rising focus on semiconductor self-sufficiency, which has driven strong production and trade growth, we also saw some progress on the innovation front.\n\nOn AI, the \"Deepseek moment\" gathered the most attention abroad and illustrated the fruits of China's AI push. The China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) estimates that the AI industry surpassed RMB 900bn in scale in 2024. The \"Eastern Data, Western Computing\" initiative, launched during the 14th Five-Year Plan, drove over RMB 1 trillion in investment and now supplies about 80% of the national intelligent computing capacity. We still see private-sector enthusiasm, too, including Alibaba's plan to invest RMB 380 billion in cloud and AI infrastructure over three years.\n\nRobotics has also been an area of strong growth. Industrial robot and service robot production were up 28.8% and 20.0% YoY YTD in October, respectively. China's so-called \"dark factories\" are examples of robotics helping to automate production to an extent where human activity is minimal, allowing the factories to operate in the dark. Recently, Xpeng's Iron robot went viral for its humanlike movements. We've seen a variety of new robot functionalities this year, including robots acting as baristas, popcorn servers, boxers, and even performing surgeries.\n\nAt the same time, this imbalance raises the question of what the impact would be on China's economy if it lost the AI race or if AI or tech exuberance faded?\n\nAt the time of writing, more market participants have been debating whether the AI exuberance has gone too far and whether we're now facing a second dotcom bubble.\n\nDuring China's National Urban Work Conference, the central government highlighted concerns about local governments' excessive investment in AI, computing power, and new energy. Similar to previous strategic industries, though, this strategy can result in the emergence of national champions. This may raise the risk of over-competition and poor resource allocation, especially as banks are called upon to support the national strategy.\n\nThe National Development and Reform Commission also recently issued a warning on potential bubble risks for the humanoid robotics industry, citing the large number of similar robots under production across multiple companies, and vowing to speed up efforts to build mechanisms for market entry and exit to facilitate an environment for fair competition.\n\nWinning the tech race would provide the most obvious catalyst for securing China's long-term growth trajectory. This is clearly spelt out in China's 15th FYP, which calls on tech and innovation to create more \"new quality productive factors\". At the same time, it's wise not to put all the eggs in one basket, so to speak. Setbacks could result in numerous failed investments and further hits to sentiment.\n\nWill China be able to break out of deflation?\n\nChina has been struggling with deflationary pressures for the past few years. China's key indicators, such as the CPI, PPI, and GDP deflator, have all pointed to outright deflation this year.\n\nThe biggest issue has been the formation of a negative feedback loop from China's cost-cutting environment. Structural causes are at the root of this, but cyclical policies also contribute to the problem. Overcapacity has led to aggressive price wars and weak profit growth. Weak profitability has in turn led to cost-cutting, wage cuts and layoffs. This fed into weaker household confidence, higher savings, and softer domestic demand, which, in turn, worsened overcapacity.\n\nOther factors playing into this dynamic include the property downturn, which creates a negative wealth effect, flatlining rental growth and the government's drive for \"belt tightening\". This included widespread pay cuts and pay caps, which heavily dented confidence and reduced dynamism. China's trade-in policy, which helped boost consumption over the past year, may also have contributed to downward price pressures by discounting popular consumer products.\n\nMany of the above issues will likely remain challenges in the coming years. China's anti-involution drive, where the government will start to crack down on excessive and destructive price competition, could eventually set inflation on a healthier trajectory. But we expect this process to be gradual, given the potential implications on local economies and employment.\n\nFor 2026, we could see prices edge back into positive territory, at least for CPI inflation. Quietly amid deflation headlines, core CPI has trended upward for six straight months since May, recovering to 1.2% YoY by October. In the past few months, food prices have been the big drag. This is cyclical, and the worst of these pressures look likely to fade in the year ahead as the pork cycle turns. Our view is that CPI will recover to 0.9% YoY in 2026.\n\nIs the PBoC already at its limit for easing?\n\nThe People's Bank of China was more cautious than expected in 2025, with only one major easing move in May to cut rates and the required reserve ratio for banks.\n\nThe limited easing can be explained by three primary factors, each with varying degrees of persuasiveness:\n\n* First, the economy held up better than expected for much of the year. With the 2025 growth target looking on track despite recent data slowdowns, there has been limited urgency for PBoC easing in the second half of the year. As nominal rates are already low, the PBoC may not wish to enter the zero-interest-rate zone that many developed markets did after the Global Financial Crisis. As such, the PBoC has been cautious in how it uses its ammunition, opting for smaller and slower rate cuts.\n\n* Second, Chinese bank net interest margins continued to narrow, squeezing profitability. One of the more compelling arguments against further easing was that rate cuts could worsen the pressure on banks.\n\n* Third, Chinese equity markets continued to rally in 2025. While the CSI 300 and Hang Seng Index continued to trade below historical valuations, the Shanghai Composite valuations began to look a little stretched, prompting some market participants to warn against fuelling a bubble.\n\nWe expect the PBoC will remain on an easing trajectory next year despite these factors:\n\n* The slowdown of the past few months shows that policy will need to remain supportive to secure another year of stable growth. This will especially be the case if we see external demand soften next year.\n\n* As we covered in the previous question, deflationary pressures will remain. Even if inflation returns to positive territory, it will likely remain quite tepid. While nominal rates look low, real rates remain too high, leading to a contraction in new RMB loans.\n\n* The property market continues to turn downward, and while rate cuts are not a cure-all, lower mortgages could help improve affordability and at least alleviate the pain.\n\nWe are currently looking for 20bp of rate cuts and 100bp of RRR cuts next year, and continued targeted support for areas of focus such as services and tech development via relending programmes.\n\nWhat's in store for the CNY next year?\n\nThe ING call that received the most pushback by far from last year's outlook was our view that the PBoC would hold the line on the yuan for a USD/CNY fluctuation band of 7.00-7.40. This time last year, the call was controversial, with many market voices expecting depreciation to support exporters ahead of a second trade war.\n\nAs it became clear that the PBoC was not only willing but also able to maintain its currency-stability stance, the range held. Our call gradually moved from outlier to consensus.\n\nAt this juncture, we see little reason to change the call for limited fluctuation in 2026. Currency stability has worked out well for China in the past few years:\n\n* A stable CNY helped avoid another area of uncertainty and avoided outflow pressures at a time when sentiment was already vulnerable.\n\n* It also provided a predictable environment to support outward direct investment, which rose 4% YoY through the first three quarters of the year despite a contraction of fixed asset investment domestically.\n\n* The tariff escalations showed that intentional depreciation likely would've been akin to throwing a bucket of water at a blazing inferno. A 10% or 20% devaluation would have done little to offset tariffs, which had surged to 145%. It likely would've prompted complaints of currency manipulation.\n\nWe expect the fluctuation band to edge down to 6.90-7.30 next year as the PBoC continues to keep a lid on volatility. Our 2026 year-end forecast for USD/CNY is 7.00, though we think this 7.00 level could be tested earlier in the year.\n\nWe view risks to our forecast over the next year as balanced toward CNY appreciation, given the narrowing US-China yield spread and the large amounts of FX held abroad by Chinese exporters that have yet to be converted back to China. If the positive momentum from the past year continues, further recovery of risk appetite and foreign investor net inflows would support the CNY. Depreciation risks could be tied to risk events that intensify capital outflow pressures and a risk-off sentiment domestically, bringing Chinese interest rates lower and widening the yield spread once more. A more hawkish-than-expected Federal Reserve and a stronger US dollar backdrop could be risks for the USD/CNY moving higher as well.\n\nThe biggest risk to our forecast band would be a pivot away from the currency stabilisation priority. Without the PBoC's use of the countercyclical factor in its fixings, we'd likely see a lot more volatility. We see no signs of this at the moment, but it cannot be ruled out if priorities shift.\n\nCould CGBs be next year's big surprise?\n\nOur view on Chinese government bonds (CGBs) looks to be one of our more non-consensus calls for the 2026 outlook. At the time of writing, we seem to be the only house expecting an uptick in CGB yields next year. Markets are expecting 10-year yields to slide to 1.58% by the end of 2026, which would mark a new historical low, while we see room for yields to move higher to 2%.\n\nOur view is that yields have been suppressed by several overlapping factors:\n\n* First, this has been a period of excessive pessimism on China, leading to portfolio rebalancing from risk assets to bonds.\n\n* Second, longer-term deflation expectations have strengthened, reducing the inflation premium.\n\n* Third, borrowing demand has been weak, while banks have seen new liquidity due to RRR cuts, leading them to invest excess liquidity in the CGB market.\n\nAn interesting feature of the CGB market over the past few years: no matter the market's actual direction, the surrounding discourse tends to be skewed negative. When yields drop, \"Japanisation\" doom and gloom permeates the market. When yields rise, we often see headlines of \"bond market routs\".\n\nTaking things into perspective, the CGB market remains well-supported, with yields well below the levels typically associated with an economy growing 4-5% per annum.\n\nWe believe that a further uptick of 10-year yields to around 2% could be a natural consequence of continued risk appetite normalisation. Despite the equity market rally of the past year, there could still be room to run, given the overall depressed economic confidence indicators and the fact that no major Chinese equity index has returned to all-time highs yet. Furthermore, bond issuance will likely need to remain high given the need for fiscal support next year.\n\nWhat are the key economic issues as the 15th Five-Year Plan begins?\n\nA draft of the 15th Five-Year Plan was made available soon after the Fourth Plenum in October. The draft is to be finalised in the coming months and approved at the Two Sessions in March, but the key themes are likely already set.\n\nThe first question laid out in this report addressed the importance of getting 2026 off to a good start to secure medium and long-term growth targets. The FYP also outlines China's priorities for the future.\n\nFirst, despite talk of cutting overcapacity in the anti-involution drive, it's clear that China has no intention of giving up its manufacturing dominance. One glaring takeaway from the FYP is that the section on industrial modernisation became the first main focus, surpassing innovation. The emphasis on upgrading traditional manufacturing while leaning on advanced manufacturing as the economic backbone aligns with China's big-picture transition up the value-added ladder.\n\nSecond, despite moving down one peg, innovation remains a key goal and is expected to create more of the so-called \"new quality productive forces\" to drive future growth. Key themes include continuing digitalisation and supporting AI+, which will be centred on bringing AI products to market. Tech self-reliance also featured prominently, indicating that China will continue to invest in building domestic capabilities in semiconductors, AI, and related strategic sectors.\n\nThird, domestic demand remained in the third slot, with the messaging tone remaining positive. The FYP mentioned that an \"implementation of special actions\" was needed to boost consumption. This strongly hints at new support ahead, following the trade-in policies of recent years. It hasn't yet specified what this might look like. We suspect that, given the concurrent focus on supporting service sector development, moves to boost consumption could target services spending, potentially via consumption vouchers.\n\nThe section on domestic demand also brought up developing more cities into international consumption centres and expanding inbound consumption. This suggests ramping up consumer imports moving forward, which represents new opportunities for China's trading partners to tap into a growing middle class.\n\nIn terms of investment, the pivot from quantity to quality is set to continue, with the government seeking to optimise investment and reform the government approval system. This aligns with the anti-involution push, where China wants less redundant and more synergistic investment to align with a national, rather than regional, development strategy.\n\nChina remains in the process of a Great Transition. This means moving toward a more domestic demand-driven growth model, up the value-added ladder and hastening green and tech transitions that will shape China's long-term economic future. The 15th FYP strategically stays the course on most of these major transitions. In 2026, it will become clearer how the government plans to execute this in practice.\n\nConclusion: China aims to get 15th five-year period off to a strong start\n\nThere are arguably three certainties in life: death, taxes, and economists talking about uncertainty in their annual outlooks. Every year's outlook write-up is often an exercise in swapping out old uncertainties for new ones.\n\nThe magnitude and expected impact of tariffs on Chinese growth were probably the biggest sources of uncertainty in 2025. Given a trade truce tentatively set to last at least until 4Q26 and China's export resilience, the tariff outlook remains a key, but less pressing issue. Instead, the focus is on whether external demand from the rest of the world holds up.\n\nArguably, the bigger questions for next year will be on domestic policy. They include how aggressive policymakers will be in providing fresh stimulus and how China will implement plans to boost domestic demand. Recent policy has been effective in front-loading demand, but the impact is fading, and confidence remains low. Fixed-asset investment growth has fallen into contractionary territory. The property market slide is accelerating. While 2025 looks likely to meet the year's growth targets, these factors represent significant question marks for 2026, especially if external demand slows more than anticipated.\n\nWith longer-term targets for 2030 and 2035 already set, getting the economy off to a good start in 2026 will be key to achieving these targets.\n\nSource: ING",

      "title": "GT Voice: China's engagement strengthens global economic growth, stability",
      "body": "Illustration: Chen Xia/GTWall Street Journal chief economics commentator Greg Ip claimed on Saturday that \"China's growth is coming at the rest of the world's expense.\"\n\nThis is an outdated zero-sum narrative that is at odds with the facts. By misrepresenting China's normal export expansion as a threat, such arguments appear intended to provide a pretext for a new round of protectionist measures in some advanced economies.\n\nThe reality, however, is quite the opposite: It is protectionism - not China's deeper integration into the global trade - that is imposing costs on the rest of the world.\n\nIn 2025, fluctuations in US tariffs have added uncertainty to global supply chains. Despite this challenging external environment, China has continued to advance its trade steadily. From January to October, China's total goods trade rose 3.6 percent year-on-year. This sustained growth is not an anomaly; it sends a clear signal to the market. Multinational companies are maintaining their engagement with the Chinese market, highlighting the resilience and tangible benefits of the cross-border production networks.\n\nThe dynamics become clearer when examined from three perspectives. First, decades of integration have built a complex China-global supply-chain system, one that reflects the logic of globalization rather than unilateral advantage.\n\nChina's trade includes sophisticated arrangements such as \"processing of supplied materials,\" under which overseas firms supply raw materials or components, while domestic enterprises carry out processing or assembly according to the overseas firms' specifications, receiving only processing fees, with the finished products sold by the overseas firms.\n\nAccording to Chinese customs data, from January to October, exports under processing and assembly trade with supplied materials increased by 13.3 percent, with corresponding imports up 10.6 percent. This demonstrates a model in which both domestic and overseas enterprises benefit from the production and China's exports.\n\nImportantly, what is commonly labeled as \"Chinese exports\" in some cases incorporates components and services sourced from other economies. Both upstream suppliers and downstream brands gain from close coordination within the global value chain. To interpret China's exports through a zero-sum lens is to fundamentally misread how modern value chains and comparative advantage function in practice.\n\nSecond, as globalization faces headwinds and protectionism rises in 2025, China has continued to open its doors wider to the world. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion and more than 400 million middle-income consumers, China represents a vast market with significant growth potential.\n\nIn 2024, China's total imports reached 18.4 trillion yuan ($2.6 trillion), up 2.3 percent year-on-year, setting a new record and maintaining its position as the world's second-largest import market for the 16th consecutive year. From hosting platforms such as the China International Import Expo to granting zero-tariff treatment on tariff lines to least developed countries with which it maintains diplomatic relations, China consistently offers foreign enterprises broad opportunities and room for development.\n\nChinese consumption is also steadily upgrading, with the services sector showing particular dynamism. From January to October, China's total services trade reached 6.58 trillion yuan, with a services trade deficit of 766.37 billion yuan. China's continued openness and market expansion provide tangible opportunities for global businesses and underscore the country's contribution to international economic resilience.\n\nThird, China's engagement with the world extends well beyond trade, encompassing multiple areas such as investment, industrial development, and infrastructure cooperation, and delivering tangible benefits to the global economy.\n\nOfficial data show that from January to October, China's outbound direct investment reached 1.03 trillion yuan, up 7 percent year-on-year. Chinese enterprises actively participate in cross-border infrastructure projects, industrial parks, and a broad range of manufacturing and industrial initiatives, generating employment and enhancing connectivity in the host countries.\n\nFar from \"coming at the rest of the world's expense,\" China's growth supports global development, strengthens supply chains, and fosters shared prosperity. These activities demonstrate that engagement and openness - not unilateralism or protectionism - remain the drivers of sustainable and inclusive economic progress.\n\nSome Western commentators have sought to cast China's exports in a negative light. Such arguments, which oppose trade and undermine free international competition, represent a new iteration of the broader anti-globalization narrative that harms the international economy. In this context, China's ongoing engagement in trade, investment, and infrastructure initiatives demonstrates how constructive participation and openness can help support the stability and resilience of the global economy.",

      "title": "Economic Watch: Global institutions upbeat about China's economic resilience, growth potential",
      "body": "BEIJING, Dec. 7 (Xinhua) -- As the year 2025 approaches its end, an increasing number of international organizations and financial institutions have successively upgraded their forecasts regarding China's economy.\n\nWhile acknowledging external uncertainties such as geopolitical tensions and trade frictions, these institutions generally believe that China's solid economic fundamentals, sufficient policy tools and structural upgrading will sustain its growth momentum.\n\nFinancial heavyweight Goldman Sachs released a research report in late November, in which it upgraded its prediction for China's 2025 real GDP growth from 4.9 percent to 5 percent, with even bigger increases forecast for the next two years.\n\nChina's real export growth is expected to increase by 5 percent to 6 percent annually over the next few years, up from a previous forecast of just 2 percent to 3 percent, as Chinese goods gain global market share, Goldman Sachs researchers wrote in their report.\n\nAt a key Party plenum in October, the Communist Party of China leadership adopted its recommendations for the formulation of the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030). \"It calls for upgrades to traditional industries such as metals, chemicals and textiles, and for growth in emerging industries like new energy,\" said the report, adding that these goals will get broad-based support from all levels of government, from logistics to financing, helping exports to grow.\n\nWhile keeping its global economic growth forecast stable at 3.2 percent, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Tuesday also revised China's GDP forecast for 2025 from 4.9 percent to 5 percent. This adjustment highlights the OECD's recognition of China as a key stabilizer for global growth.\n\nThe OECD noted that, China's fiscal policy has been expansionary with the introduction of a number of measures to support incomes and boost consumption, in addition to the trade-in program for cars and household appliances.\n\nMultiple foreign institutions have also voiced confidence in China's policy toolkit. Xiong Yi, chief China economist at Deutsche Bank, believes China's intensification of its fiscal policy, including a new policy-based financial instrument worth 500 billion yuan (about 70.67 billion U.S. dollars), is likely to provide strong support for domestic demand in both the fourth quarter and early 2026.\n\nMorgan Stanley, in its latest research report, emphasized that China's economy will grow moderately in 2026, supported by targeted policy easing, gradual economic rebalancing and an anti-involution campaign.\n\nDomestically, leading financial institutions also echo this optimistic outlook. Zhao Gege, chief macro analyst at Everbright Securities, emphasized China's unique advantages. \"The synergy between the super-large-scale market and a strong industrial system provides ample room for growth, with a well-stocked macro policy toolbox.\"\n\nZhang Wenlang, chief macroeconomist at China International Capital Corporation, noted that China's foreign trade structure is improving, with technological progress reducing trade costs and stabilizing export enterprises' profit margins.\n\nZhou Junzhi, chief macro analyst at China Securities Co., Ltd., said new consumption segments are emerging as new growth engines, with IP trend toys and domestic brands gaining greater market recognition and accelerating their global expansion.\n\nMoreover, many global giants have shown their optimism about the prospects of China's economic development and their willingness to commit to long-term cooperation with China.\n\nIn September, Danfoss opened a major production base in Haiyan County, east China's Zhejiang Province. In October, Medtronic opened its first digital healthcare innovation center in Beijing, while in November, AP Moller-Maersk opened its flagship logistics center in east China's Shanghai with an investment of over 1 billion yuan.\n\nNotably, this year's import expo in Shanghai recorded 83.49 billion U.S. dollars in one-year intended deals, up 4.4 percent from the previous edition and hitting a new high. Meanwhile, the 138th Canton Fair in south China's Guangzhou saw more than 310,000 overseas buyers and registered on-site intended export transactions worth a total of 25.65 billion U.S. dollars.\n\nStable operation, solid progress in high-quality development and inherent strengths of strong resilience and great potential -- none of these fundamentals have changed, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics said, citing the overall performance of China's economy. \u25a0",

      "title": "China's November exports expected to have rebounded off US tariff truce",
      "body": "China's exports likely returned to growth in November after an unexpected dip in October, as manufacturers rushed to move inventory to take advantage of a fresh tariff truce with the U.S.\n\nIn a deal in late October that followed a sharp escalation in tensions between the world's top two economies, President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to trim their tariffs and pause a raft of other measures.\n\nOutbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy in November were expected to have risen by 3.8% by value year-on-year, according to the median forecast of 20 economists in a Reuters poll, after a 1.1% contraction a month earlier - the worst performance since February.\n\nImports were forecast to have climbed 2.8%, compared with a lacklustre 1.0% gain the month earlier, as a protracted property slump continues to drag on consumer confidence and the broader economy.\n\nManufacturers have spent the past year trying to tap new markets in Europe, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, but slowing global growth and rising trade barriers mean factory owners are struggling to replenish order books even as tensions between Beijing and Washington ease.\n\nChina's factory activity shrank for an eighth month in November, an official manufacturing survey showed, with new orders and new export orders remaining in contraction.\n\nEconomists estimate that diminished access to the U.S. market has reduced China's export growth by roughly 2 percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3% of GDP. Despite the truce, Trump's levies on Chinese goods remain around 50%, weighing heavily on the more than $400 billion in annual exports to the world's top consumer market.\n\nChina is likely to stick to its current annual economic growth target of around 5% next year, government advisers and analysts said, as Beijing is set to embark on a new five-year plan with sharper focus on boosting consumer demand and advancing technological self-reliance.\n\nChina's November trade surplus is expected to rise to $100.15 billion, up from $90.07 billion in October but still below the monthly average of $110.7 billion recorded so far this year.\n\nThe official data from China's customs administration will be released on Monday at 11 a.m. (0300 GMT).\n\nSource: Reuters",

      "title": "China's November exports expected to have rebounded off US tariff truce",
      "body": "BEIJING, Dec 5 (Reuters) - China's exports likely returned to growth in November after an unexpected dip in October, as manufacturers rushed to move inventory to take advantage of a fresh tariff truce with the U.S.\n\nIn a deal in late October that followed a sharp escalation in tensions between the world's top two economies, President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to trim their tariffs and pause a raft of other measures.\n\nOutbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy in November were expected to have risen by 3.8% by value year-on-year, according to the median forecast of 20 economists in a Reuters poll, after a 1.1% contraction a \u2060month earlier - the worst performance since February.\n\nImports were forecast to have climbed 2.8%, compared with a lacklustre 1.0% gain the month earlier, as a protracted property slump continues to drag on consumer confidence and the broader economy.\n\nManufacturers have spent the past year trying to tap new markets in Europe, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, but slowing global growth and rising trade barriers mean factory owners are struggling to replenish order books even as tensions between Beijing and Washington ease.\n\nChina's factory activity shrank for an eighth month in November, an official manufacturing survey showed, with new orders and new export orders remaining in contraction.\n\nEconomists estimate that diminished access to the U.S. market has reduced China's export growth by roughly 2 percentage points, equivalent to around 0.3% of GDP. Despite the truce, Trump's levies on Chinese goods remain around 50%, weighing heavily on the \u2060more than $400 billion in annual exports to the world's top consumer market.\n\nChina is likely to stick to its current annual economic growth target of around 5% next year, government advisers and analysts said, as Beijing is set to embark on a new five-year plan with sharper focus on \u2060boosting consumer demand and advancing technological self-reliance.\n\nChina's November trade surplus is expected to rise to $100.15 billion, up from $90.07 billion in October but still below the monthly average of $110.7 billion \u2060recorded so far this year.\n\nThe official data from China's customs administration will be released on Monday at 11 a.m. (0300 GMT).\n\n(Reporting by Xiuhao Chen and Joe Cash; Polling by Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan in Bengaluru and Jing Wang in ShanghaiEditing by Shri Navaratnam)",

  "executive_brief": "China's export performance presents a mixed picture: overall exports grew by 5.9% in November, but shipments to the US continue to decline sharply (nearly 29% for the eighth consecutive month). This event is receiving significant media attention, with 140 articles from 106 sources covering the topic, and a slightly positive average sentiment score of 0.11. The data suggests a shift in China's trade dynamics, with growth increasingly reliant on markets beyond the US, despite ongoing trade tensions. \n\nStakeholder positions are divided. While China and entities like Morgan Stanley anticipate continued export resilience and market share gains, particularly in advanced manufacturing, the European Union, led by Emmanuel Macron, expresses strong concerns about China\u2019s growing trade surplus and its impact on European industries. Macron directly criticizes the imbalance, suggesting it harms China\u2019s own customers. Financially, China is targeting a GDP of CNY 170,000,000,000,000 by 2030, and has already achieved a trade surplus exceeding USD 1 trillion, even with US tariffs in place.",
