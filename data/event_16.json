She also noted that Germany's updated national hydrogen and import strategies reaffirm hydrogen's indispensable role in decarbonising hard-to-abate industries.\n\nThe national hydrogen policy draft outlines a clear roadmap for deploying green and low-carbon hydrogen to drive industrial growth, enhance energy security, create jobs, and strengthen climate resilience.\n\nAccording to the Hydrogen Policy Technical Working Group, comprising the Federal Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning and the Ministry of Petroleum Resources (Gas), the policy \"positions Nigeria as a regional and global hydrogen leader while accelerating energy transition and industrial development.\"\n\n\"This framework provides certainty to investors and signals Nigeria's leadership in climate innovation,\" the Ambassador affirmed, reiterating Germany's commitment to supporting its implementation through the German-Nigerian Hydrogen Office in Abuja.\n\nDiscussions throughout the symposium focused on translating ambition into implementation, with strong emphasis on private-sector leadership, the statement said.\n\nBastian Lidzba, Delegate of AHK Nigeria, stated: \"The success of the hydrogen economy depends not only on sound policy, but on strong partnerships, mobilised capital, and market-driven solutions.\"\n\nReflecting on five decades of bilateral energy cooperation, Dr. Markus Wagner, Country Director of GIZ Nigeria & ECOWAS, noted that the German-Nigerian Hydrogen Office serves as a strategic platform to accelerate global energy transition while positioning Nigeria competitively in emerging energy markets.\n\n\"Africa's energy access challenge is a technology challenge at its core. Policy may enable, but true transition will be engineered through indigenous innovation -- not legislated,\" said Prof. Emeka Oguzie from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria.\n\nThrough H2-diplo, Germany is building a global network of partnerships to ensure that green hydrogen becomes a cornerstone of worldwide decarbonisation -- bridging technology, policy, and economic opportunity.",

This collaboration is receiving positive coverage across six articles from six sources, with an average sentiment score of 0.78, indicating strong support for the initiative. The partnership aims to accelerate the global transition to a hydrogen economy and position Nigeria as a key player in Africa's emerging energy markets. \n\nKey stakeholders, including Germany, Nigeria, GIZ, and AHK Nigeria, all express support for the partnership. Annett G\u00fcnther, the German Ambassador to Nigeria, emphasizes the importance of the symposium as a platform for translating policy into action and attracting investment. Bastian Lidzba of AHK Nigeria highlights the need for strong partnerships and mobilized capital. While the data doesn't include specific financial commitments, the focus is on creating a framework for investment and industrial decarbonization.",
