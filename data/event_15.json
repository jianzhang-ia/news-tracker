The prospect has prompted calls within the EU for a coordinated response.\n\nAhead of renewed trade talks expected in early 2026, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck has urged companies to diversify into Asian markets to reduce reliance on the U.S. market.",

Between 2016 and 2024, exports had risen by an average of about 5 percent annually. The latest figures put German exports to the U.S. below their 2022 level.\n\nThe downturn was concentrated in Germany's core industrial sectors. Almost 70 percent of the decline came from automotive, chemical, and mechanical engineering industries, the IW reported. While automotive exports fell the most, mechanical engineering and chemical shipments each dropped by just under 10 percent.\n\nHigh U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, currently at 50 percent, were a key factor behind the weakness in mechanical engineering exports, the institute said. Chemical exports were also affected by domestic factors, including lower production in Germany due to high energy prices.\n\nWith a swift rollback of Trump-era tariffs unlikely, Germany needs to diversify its trade ties, IW economist Samina Sultan said.\n\nGermany should expand into new markets in South America, India and Indonesia, while reducing trade barriers within the European Union, she added. \u25a0",

Despite the reduction compared to the initial threats, the blow to the German automotive industry has been heavy, with the sector recording the largest drop in exports to the American market.\n\nGerman mechanical engineering companies also found themselves in a precarious position under the new tariff regime. The study shows that exports in this specific sector to the USA decreased by 9.5% in the first nine months of 2025. Machinery exports are further burdened by a 50% tariff imposed by the USA on steel and aluminum products, further increasing costs and reducing competitiveness.\n\nThe chemical industry also recorded a decrease in exports to Germany's largest export market, with a drop of 9.5%. However, the report points out that this decline cannot be attributed exclusively to tariffs. As characteristically stated, \"other factors are likely to have played a role in the case of chemical products, such as lower production in Germany due to higher energy prices.\"\n\nOverall, German exports to the United States decreased by 7.8% on an annual basis in the nine-month period, following an average increase of nearly 5% in corresponding periods from 2016 to 2024.\n\n\"Given that it must now be assumed that American import tariffs will not return to pre-Trump administration levels in the near future, a substantial recovery of German exports to the USA is unlikely,\" stated the study's author, Samina Sultan, referring to a \"new normalcy\" for German exporters.",

      "body": "German exports to the United States recorded a significant downturn in 2025, underscoring the lasting impact of U.S. trade policies on Europe's largest economy. According to a study cited by Reuters, German car exports to the U.S. fell by nearly 14% in the first three quarters of the year, making the automotive sector the hardest hit branch of German industry amid President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war.\n\nThe decline comes despite a trade agreement between Washington and Brussels that reduced the overall tariff burden. Under the deal, the United States imposed a 15% baseline tariff on cars imported from Europe starting August 1, notably lower than the initial proposal of a 25% tariff in addition to the existing 2.5% levy. Even with this concession, German automakers struggled to maintain export volumes, reflecting weaker demand and higher trade barriers in their most important non-European market.\n\nThe challenges extend well beyond the automotive industry. German engineering companies also experienced a sharp contraction, with exports to the U.S. down 9.5% during the first nine months of 2025. Machinery exports have been particularly affected, as they are subject to a steep 50% U.S. tariff on steel and aluminium products, significantly raising costs and reducing competitiveness.\n\nThe chemical industry similarly saw exports to the United States decline by 9.5% over the same period. However, the report noted that tariffs were not the sole factor behind this drop. Higher energy prices in Germany and reduced domestic production were also cited as key contributors to the sector's weaker performance.\n\nOverall, German exports to the U.S. fell by 7.8% year on year across all industries during the first three quarters of 2025. This marks a sharp reversal from the average growth rate of nearly 5% recorded in comparable periods between 2016 and 2024. Study author Samina Sultan warned that a strong rebound is unlikely, stating that U.S. import tariffs are not expected to return to pre-Trump levels in the foreseeable future. As a result, German exporters may be forced to adapt to what she described as a \"new normal\" in transatlantic trade relations.",
