The official spoke to on Wednesday the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations.\n\nThe U.S. had been pursuing the tanker since last month after it tried to evade a U.S. blockade on sanctioned oil vessels around Venezuela. It had been sanctioned by the U.S. in 2024 for allegedly smuggling cargo for a company linked to Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The U.S. Coast Guard attempted to board it in the Caribbean in December as it headed for Venezuela.\n\nThe ship refused boarding and as it headed across the Atlantic, its name was changed from the Bella 1 to the Marinera and was reflagged to Russia, shipping databases show.\n\nOfficials in the administration of President Donald Trump have said the U.S. will continue to seize sanctioned vessels connected to Venezuela after capturing President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.\n\nThe Latest:\n\nUS forces board Venezuela-linked sanctioned oil tanker in North Atlantic\n\nA U.S. official says U.S. forces have boarded a Venezuela-linked sanctioned oil tanker in North Atlantic after pursuing it for weeks. The official spoke to on Wednesday the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations.\n\nThe U.S. had been pursuing the tanker since last month after it tried to evade a U.S. blockade around Venezuela.\n\nHow Delcy Rodriguez courted Donald Trump and rose to power in Venezuela\n\nIn 2017, as political outsider Donald Trump headed to Washington, Delcy Rodriguez spotted an opening.\n\nThen Venezuela's foreign minister, Rodriguez directed Citgo -- a subsidiary of the state oil company -- to make a $500,000 donation to the president's inauguration. With the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro struggling to feed Venezuela, Rodriguez gambled on a deal that would have opened the door to American investment.\n\nAround the same time, she saw that Trump's ex-campaign manager was hired as a lobbyist for Citgo, courted Republicans in Congress and tried to secure a meeting with the head of Exxon. The charm offensive flopped, but it made Rodriguez a prominent face in U.S. business and political circles, paving the way for her own rise. And nearly a decade later, as Venezuela's interim president, Rodriguez's message -- that Venezuela is open for business -- seems to have persuaded Trump.\n\nIn the days since Maduro's stunning capture Saturday, he's alternately praised Rodriguez as a \"gracious\" American partner while threatening a similar fate as her former boss if she doesn't keep the ruling party in check and provide the U.S. with \"total access\" to the country's vast oil reserves. One thing neither has mentioned is elections, something the constitution mandates must take place within 30 days of the presidency being permanently vacated.\n\n? Read more about Delcy Rodriguez and her relationship with Trump\n\nTrump's former Russia adviser says Russia offered US free rein in Venezuela in exchange for Ukraine\n\nRussian officials indicated in 2019 that the Kremlin would be willing to back off from its support for Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela in exchange for a free hand in Ukraine, according to Fiona Hill, an adviser to President Donald Trump at the time.\n\nThe Russians repeatedly floated the idea of a \"very strange swap arrangement between Venezuela and Ukraine,\" Hill said during a congressional hearing in 2019. Her comments surfaced again this week and were shared on social media after the U.S. stealth operation to capture Maduro.\n\nHill said Russia pushed the idea through articles in Russian media that referenced the Monroe Doctrine -- a 19th-century principle in which the U.S. opposed European meddling in the Western Hemisphere and in return agreed to stay out of European affairs. It was invoked by Trump to justify the U.S. intervention in Venezuela.\n\nEven though Russian officials never made a formal offer, Moscow's then-ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, hinted many times to her that Russia was willing to allow the United States to act as it wished in Venezuela if the U.S. did the same for Russia in Europe, Hill told this week.\n\n? Read more about the former adviser's remarks\n\nFifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack brings fresh division to the US Capitol\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021, there is no official event to memorialize what happened that day, when the mob made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue, battled police at the Capitol barricades and stormed inside, as lawmakers fled. The political parties refuse to agree on a shared history of the events, which were broadcast around the globe. And the official plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol has never been hung.\n\nInstead, the day displayed the divisions that still define Washington, and the country, and the White House itself issued a glossy new report with its own revised history of what happened.\n\nTrump, during a lengthy morning speech to House Republicans away from the Capitol at the rebranded Kennedy Center now carrying his own name, shifted blame for Jan. 6 onto the rioters themselves. Democrats meanwhile reconvened members of the House committee that investigated the attack for a panel discussion to prevent what Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described as the GOP's \"Orwellian project of forgetting.\"\n\n?

Read more about Trump's interest in Greenland\n\nVenezuelan oil redirected to the U.S.?\n\nTrump said Tuesday that the nation would provide 30 to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., pledging to use proceeds from the sale of this oil \"to benefit the people\" of both countries. The Venezuelan government had no immediate comment on this announcement. White House is organizing a meeting Friday with U.S. oil company executives from companies like Exxon and Chevron to discuss Venezuela, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the plans.\n\nTrump pulling social safety net from Democratic states\n\nThe administration is withholding funding for programs that support needy families with children in five Democratic-led states over concerns about fraud -- California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the program, will require the states to provide extra documentation to access the funds, but the administration did not detail the fraud allegations. Gov. Kathy Hochul said New York is prepared to litigate to maintain support for some of the poorest American families.\n\nPolling shows Americans doubt Trump on Venezuela\n\nTrump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course -- but not always limitless faith. Trump's intensifying rhetoric about expanding U.S. power elsewhere in the hemisphere made some of his die-hard supporters nervous.\n\nPolling conducted in the immediate aftermath of the military operation suggested that many Americans are unconvinced that the U.S. should step in to take control of the country.",

Trump has floated since his first term the idea of acquiring the world's largest island to ensure U.S. security in the Arctic.\n\nThe Latest:\n\nUS forces board Venezuela-linked sanctioned oil tanker in North Atlantic after pursuing it for weeks, US official says\n\nA U.S. official says U.S. forces have boarded a Venezuela-linked sanctioned oil tanker in North Atlantic after pursuing it for weeks. The official spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations.\n\nThe U.S. had been pursuing the tanker since last month after it tried to evade a U.S. blockade around Venezuela.\n\nHow Delcy Rodr\u00edguez courted Donald Trump and rose to power in Venezuela\n\nIn 2017, as political outsider Donald Trump headed to Washington, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez spotted an opening.\n\nThen Venezuela's foreign minister, Rodr\u00edguez directed Citgo -- a subsidiary of the state oil company -- to make a $500,000 donation to the president's inauguration. With the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro struggling to feed Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez gambled on a deal that would have opened the door to American investment.\n\nAround the same time, she saw that Trump's ex-campaign manager was hired as a lobbyist for Citgo, courted Republicans in Congress and tried to secure a meeting with the head of Exxon.\n\nThe charm offensive flopped. Within weeks of taking office, Trump, urged by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, made restoring Venezuela's democracy his driving focus in response to Maduro's crackdown on opponents. But the outreach did bear fruit for Rodr\u00edguez, making her a prominent face in U.S. business and political circles and paving the way for her own rise.\n\nNearly a decade later, as Venezuela's interim president, Rodr\u00edguez's message -- that Venezuela is open for business -- seems to have persuaded Trump. In the days since Maduro's stunning capture Saturday, he's alternately praised Rodr\u00edguez as a \"gracious\" American partner while threatening a similar fate as her former boss if she doesn't keep the ruling party in check and provide the U.S. with \"total access\" to the country's vast oil reserves. One thing neither has mentioned is elections, something the constitution mandates must take place within 30 days of the presidency being permanently vacated.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and her relationship with Trump\n\nTrump's former Russia adviser says Russia offered US free rein in Venezuela in exchange for Ukraine\n\nRussian officials indicated in 2019 that the Kremlin would be willing to back off from its support for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela in exchange for a free hand in Ukraine, according to Fiona Hill, an adviser to President Donald Trump at the time.\n\nThe Russians repeatedly floated the idea of a \"very strange swap arrangement between Venezuela and Ukraine,\" Hill said during a congressional hearing in 2019. Her comments surfaced again this week and were shared on social media after the U.S. stealth operation to capture Maduro.\n\nHill said Russia pushed the idea through articles in Russian media that referenced the Monroe Doctrine -- a 19th-century principle in which the U.S. opposed European meddling in the Western Hemisphere and in return agreed to stay out of European affairs. It was invoked by Trump to justify the U.S. intervention in Venezuela.\n\nEven though Russian officials never made a formal offer, Moscow's then-ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, hinted many times to her that Russia was willing to allow the United States to act as it wished in Venezuela if the U.S. did the same for Russia in Europe, Hill told The Associated Press this week.\n\nRead more about the former adviser's remarks\n\nFifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack brings fresh division to the US Capitol\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021, there is no official event to memorialize what happened that day, when the mob made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue, battled police at the Capitol barricades and stormed inside, as lawmakers fled. The political parties refuse to agree on a shared history of the events, which were broadcast around the globe. And the official plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol has never been hung.\n\nInstead, the day displayed the divisions that still define Washington, and the country, and the White House itself issued a glossy new report with its own revised history of what happened.\n\nTrump, during a lengthy morning speech to House Republicans away from the Capitol at the rebranded Kennedy Center now carrying his own name, shifted blame for Jan. 6 onto the rioters themselves.

      "body": "Denmark and Greenland are seeking a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio after the Trump administration doubled down on its intention to take over the strategic Arctic island, a self-governing Danish territory.\n\nTensions escalated after the White House said Tuesday that the \"U.S. military is always an option,\" even as a series of European leaders rejected President Donald Trump's renewed demands and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that a U.S. takeover would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Trump has floated since his first term the idea of acquiring the world's largest island to ensure U.S. security in the Arctic.\n\nThe Latest: How Delcy Rodr\u00edguez courted Donald Trump and rose to power in Venezuela\n\nIn 2017, as political outsider Donald Trump headed to Washington, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez spotted an opening.\n\nThen Venezuela's foreign minister, Rodr\u00edguez directed Citgo -- a subsidiary of the state oil company -- to make a $500,000 donation to the president's inauguration. With the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro struggling to feed Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez gambled on a deal that would have opened the door to American investment.\n\nAround the same time, she saw that Trump's ex-campaign manager was hired as a lobbyist for Citgo, courted Republicans in Congress and tried to secure a meeting with the head of Exxon.\n\nThe charm offensive flopped. Within weeks of taking office, Trump, urged by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, made restoring Venezuela's democracy his driving focus in response to Maduro's crackdown on opponents. But the outreach did bear fruit for Rodr\u00edguez, making her a prominent face in U.S. business and political circles and paving the way for her own rise.\n\nNearly a decade later, as Venezuela's interim president, Rodr\u00edguez's message -- that Venezuela is open for business -- seems to have persuaded Trump. In the days since Maduro's stunning capture Saturday, he's alternately praised Rodr\u00edguez as a \"gracious\" American partner while threatening a similar fate as her former boss if she doesn't keep the ruling party in check and provide the U.S. with \"total access\" to the country's vast oil reserves. One thing neither has mentioned is elections, something the constitution mandates must take place within 30 days of the presidency being permanently vacated.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and her relationship with Trump Trump's former Russia adviser says Russia offered US free rein in Venezuela in exchange for Ukraine\n\nRussian officials indicated in 2019 that the Kremlin would be willing to back off from its support for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela in exchange for a free hand in Ukraine, according to Fiona Hill, an adviser to President Donald Trump at the time.\n\nThe Russians repeatedly floated the idea of a \"very strange swap arrangement between Venezuela and Ukraine,\" Hill said during a congressional hearing in 2019. Her comments surfaced again this week and were shared on social media after the U.S. stealth operation to capture Maduro.\n\nHill said Russia pushed the idea through articles in Russian media that referenced the Monroe Doctrine -- a 19th-century principle in which the U.S. opposed European meddling in the Western Hemisphere and in return agreed to stay out of European affairs. It was invoked by Trump to justify the U.S. intervention in Venezuela.\n\nEven though Russian officials never made a formal offer, Moscow's then-ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, hinted many times to her that Russia was willing to allow the United States to act as it wished in Venezuela if the U.S. did the same for Russia in Europe, Hill told The Associated Press this week.\n\nRead more about the former adviser's remarks Fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack brings fresh division to the US Capitol\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021, there is no official event to memorialize what happened that day, when the mob made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue, battled police at the Capitol barricades and stormed inside, as lawmakers fled.

      "body": "A U.S. official says U.S. forces have boarded a Venezuela-linked sanctioned oil tanker in the North Atlantic after pursuing it for weeks. The official spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations.\n\nThe U.S. had been pursuing the tanker since last month after it tried to evade a U.S. blockade on sanctioned oil vessels around Venezuela. It had been sanctioned by the U.S. in 2024 for allegedly smuggling cargo for a company linked to Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The U.S. Coast Guard attempted to board it in the Caribbean in December as it headed for Venezuela.\n\nThe ship refused boarding and as it headed across the Atlantic, its name was changed from the Bella 1 to the Marinera and was reflagged to Russia, shipping databases show.\n\nOfficials in the administration of President Donald Trump have said the U.S. will continue to seize sanctioned vessels connected to Venezuela after capturing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.\n\nThe Latest:\n\nUS forces board Venezuela-linked sanctioned oil tanker in North Atlantic\n\nA U.S. official says U.S. forces have boarded a Venezuela-linked sanctioned oil tanker in North Atlantic after pursuing it for weeks. The official spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations.\n\nThe U.S. had been pursuing the tanker since last month after it tried to evade a U.S. blockade around Venezuela.\n\nHow Delcy Rodr\u00edguez courted Donald Trump and rose to power in Venezuela\n\nIn 2017, as political outsider Donald Trump headed to Washington, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez spotted an opening.\n\nThen Venezuela's foreign minister, Rodr\u00edguez directed Citgo -- a subsidiary of the state oil company -- to make a $500,000 donation to the president's inauguration. With the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro struggling to feed Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez gambled on a deal that would have opened the door to American investment.\n\nAround the same time, she saw that Trump's ex-campaign manager was hired as a lobbyist for Citgo, courted Republicans in Congress and tried to secure a meeting with the head of Exxon. The charm offensive flopped, but it made Rodr\u00edguez a prominent face in U.S. business and political circles, paving the way for her own rise. And nearly a decade later, as Venezuela's interim president, Rodr\u00edguez's message -- that Venezuela is open for business -- seems to have persuaded Trump.\n\nIn the days since Maduro's stunning capture Saturday, he's alternately praised Rodr\u00edguez as a \"gracious\" American partner while threatening a similar fate as her former boss if she doesn't keep the ruling party in check and provide the U.S. with \"total access\" to the country's vast oil reserves. One thing neither has mentioned is elections, something the constitution mandates must take place within 30 days of the presidency being permanently vacated.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and her relationship with Trump\n\nTrump's former Russia adviser says Russia offered US free rein in Venezuela in exchange for Ukraine\n\nRussian officials indicated in 2019 that the Kremlin would be willing to back off from its support for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela in exchange for a free hand in Ukraine, according to Fiona Hill, an adviser to President Donald Trump at the time.\n\nThe Russians repeatedly floated the idea of a \"very strange swap arrangement between Venezuela and Ukraine,\" Hill said during a congressional hearing in 2019. Her comments surfaced again this week and were shared on social media after the U.S. stealth operation to capture Maduro.\n\nHill said Russia pushed the idea through articles in Russian media that referenced the Monroe Doctrine -- a 19th-century principle in which the U.S. opposed European meddling in the Western Hemisphere and in return agreed to stay out of European affairs. It was invoked by Trump to justify the U.S. intervention in Venezuela.\n\nEven though Russian officials never made a formal offer, Moscow's then-ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, hinted many times to her that Russia was willing to allow the United States to act as it wished in Venezuela if the U.S. did the same for Russia in Europe, Hill told The Associated Press this week.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the former adviser's remarks\n\nFifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack brings fresh division to the US Capitol\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021, there is no official event to memorialize what happened that day, when the mob made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue, battled police at the Capitol barricades and stormed inside, as lawmakers fled. The political parties refuse to agree on a shared history of the events, which were broadcast around the globe. And the official plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol has never been hung.\n\nInstead, the day displayed the divisions that still define Washington, and the country, and the White House itself issued a glossy new report with its own revised history of what happened.\n\nTrump, during a lengthy morning speech to House Republicans away from the Capitol at the rebranded Kennedy Center now carrying his own name, shifted blame for Jan. 6 onto the rioters themselves. Democrats meanwhile reconvened members of the House committee that investigated the attack for a panel discussion to prevent what Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described as the GOP's \"Orwellian project of forgetting.\"\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack\n\nDenmark and Greenland seek talks with Rubio over US interest in taking the island\n\nDenmark and Greenland are seeking a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio after the Trump administration doubled down on its intention to take over the strategic Arctic island, a Danish territory.\n\nThis weekend's U.S. military action in Venezuela has heightened fears across Europe, and Trump and his advisers in recent days have reiterated the U.S. leader's desire to take over the island, which guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.\n\n\"It's so strategic right now,\" Trump told reporters Sunday.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart, Vivian Motzfeldt, have requested the meeting with Rubio in the near future, according to a statement posted Tuesday to Greenland's government website.\n\nPrevious requests for a sit-down were not successful, the statement said.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Trump's interest in Greenland\n\nVenezuelan oil redirected to the U.S.?\n\nTrump said Tuesday that the nation would provide 30 to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., pledging to use proceeds from the sale of this oil \"to benefit the people\" of both countries.

      "body": "In a bid to address growing geopolitical tensions, Denmark and Greenland are requesting a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This request follows the Trump administration's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, a strategic Arctic territory under Danish sovereignty.\n\nThe situation intensified when the White House declared on Tuesday that \"the U.S. military is always an option,\" despite resistance from European leaders. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen cautioned that any U.S. acquisition of Greenland could spell the end of the NATO alliance. President Donald Trump has long considered the purchase of Greenland as a strategic move to bolster U.S. security in the Arctic region.\n\nIn other developments, the possibility of Venezuelan oil shipments to the United States has emerged. On Tuesday, President Trump announced plans to secure 30 to 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, with the proceeds intended to benefit both nations. The Venezuelan government has yet to respond to this proposal. Meanwhile, the White House is organizing a meeting on Friday with executives from major U.S. oil companies, including Exxon and Chevron, to discuss potential dealings with Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nAdditionally, there are reports that President Trump might be scaling back social safety nets in states governed by Democrats, though specific details remain unclear at this time.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that the nation would provide 30 to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., pledging to use proceeds from the sale of this oil \"to benefit the people\" of both countries.

      "body": "Denmark and Greenland are seeking a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio after the Trump administration doubled down on its intention to take over the strategic Arctic island, a self-governing Danish territory.\n\nTensions escalated after the White House said Tuesday that the \"U.S. military is always an option,\" even as a series of European leaders rejected President Donald Trump's renewed demands and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that a U.S. takeover would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Trump has floated since his first term the idea of acquiring the world's largest island to ensure U.S. security in the Arctic.\n\nThe Latest:\n\nHow Delcy Rodr\u00edguez courted Donald Trump and rose to power in Venezuela\n\nIn 2017, as political outsider Donald Trump headed to Washington, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez spotted an opening.\n\nThen Venezuela's foreign minister, Rodr\u00edguez directed Citgo -- a subsidiary of the state oil company -- to make a $500,000 donation to the president's inauguration. With the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro struggling to feed Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez gambled on a deal that would have opened the door to American investment.\n\nAround the same time, she saw that Trump's ex-campaign manager was hired as a lobbyist for Citgo, courted Republicans in Congress and tried to secure a meeting with the head of Exxon.\n\nThe charm offensive flopped. Within weeks of taking office, Trump, urged by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, made restoring Venezuela's democracy his driving focus in response to Maduro's crackdown on opponents. But the outreach did bear fruit for Rodr\u00edguez, making her a prominent face in U.S. business and political circles and paving the way for her own rise.\n\nNearly a decade later, as Venezuela's interim president, Rodr\u00edguez's message -- that Venezuela is open for business -- seems to have persuaded Trump. In the days since Maduro's stunning capture Saturday, he's alternately praised Rodr\u00edguez as a \"gracious\" American partner while threatening a similar fate as her former boss if she doesn't keep the ruling party in check and provide the U.S. with \"total access\" to the country's vast oil reserves. One thing neither has mentioned is elections, something the constitution mandates must take place within 30 days of the presidency being permanently vacated.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and her relationship with Trump\n\nTrump's former Russia adviser says Russia offered US free rein in Venezuela in exchange for Ukraine\n\nRussian officials indicated in 2019 that the Kremlin would be willing to back off from its support for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela in exchange for a free hand in Ukraine, according to Fiona Hill, an adviser to President Donald Trump at the time.\n\nThe Russians repeatedly floated the idea of a \"very strange swap arrangement between Venezuela and Ukraine,\" Hill said during a congressional hearing in 2019. Her comments surfaced again this week and were shared on social media after the U.S. stealth operation to capture Maduro.\n\nHill said Russia pushed the idea through articles in Russian media that referenced the Monroe Doctrine -- a 19th-century principle in which the U.S. opposed European meddling in the Western Hemisphere and in return agreed to stay out of European affairs. It was invoked by Trump to justify the U.S. intervention in Venezuela.\n\nEven though Russian officials never made a formal offer, Moscow's then-ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, hinted many times to her that Russia was willing to allow the United States to act as it wished in Venezuela if the U.S. did the same for Russia in Europe, Hill told The Associated Press this week.\n\nRead more about the former adviser's remarks\n\nFifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack brings fresh division to the US Capitol\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021, there is no official event to memorialize what happened that day, when the mob made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue, battled police at the Capitol barricades and stormed inside, as lawmakers fled. The political parties refuse to agree on a shared history of the events, which were broadcast around the globe. And the official plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol has never been hung.\n\nInstead, the day displayed the divisions that still define Washington, and the country, and the White House itself issued a glossy new report with its own revised history of what happened.\n\nTrump, during a lengthy morning speech to House Republicans away from the Capitol at the rebranded Kennedy Center now carrying his own name, shifted blame for Jan. 6 onto the rioters themselves.

      "body": "Denmark and Greenland are seeking a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio after the Trump administration doubled down on its intention to take over the strategic Arctic island, a self-governing Danish territory.\n\nTensions escalated after the White House said Tuesday that the \"U.S. military is always an option,\" even as a series of European leaders rejected President Donald Trump's renewed demands and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that a U.S. takeover would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Trump has floated since his first term the idea of acquiring the world's largest island to ensure U.S. security in the Arctic.\n\nThe Latest:\n\nIn 2017, as political outsider Donald Trump headed to Washington, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez spotted an opening.\n\nThen Venezuela's foreign minister, Rodr\u00edguez directed Citgo -- a subsidiary of the state oil company -- to make a $500,000 donation to the president's inauguration. With the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro struggling to feed Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez gambled on a deal that would have opened the door to American investment.\n\nAround the same time, she saw that Trump's ex-campaign manager was hired as a lobbyist for Citgo, courted Republicans in Congress and tried to secure a meeting with the head of Exxon.\n\nThe charm offensive flopped. Within weeks of taking office, Trump, urged by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, made restoring Venezuela's democracy his driving focus in response to Maduro's crackdown on opponents. But the outreach did bear fruit for Rodr\u00edguez, making her a prominent face in U.S. business and political circles and paving the way for her own rise.\n\nNearly a decade later, as Venezuela's interim president, Rodr\u00edguez's message -- that Venezuela is open for business -- seems to have persuaded Trump. In the days since Maduro's stunning capture Saturday, he's alternately praised Rodr\u00edguez as a \"gracious\" American partner while threatening a similar fate as her former boss if she doesn't keep the ruling party in check and provide the U.S. with \"total access\" to the country's vast oil reserves. One thing neither has mentioned is elections, something the constitution mandates must take place within 30 days of the presidency being permanently vacated.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and her relationship with Trump\n\nRussian officials indicated in 2019 that the Kremlin would be willing to back off from its support for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela in exchange for a free hand in Ukraine, according to Fiona Hill, an adviser to President Donald Trump at the time.\n\nThe Russians repeatedly floated the idea of a \"very strange swap arrangement between Venezuela and Ukraine,\" Hill said during a congressional hearing in 2019. Her comments surfaced again this week and were shared on social media after the U.S. stealth operation to capture Maduro.\n\nHill said Russia pushed the idea through articles in Russian media that referenced the Monroe Doctrine -- a 19th-century principle in which the U.S. opposed European meddling in the Western Hemisphere and in return agreed to stay out of European affairs. It was invoked by Trump to justify the U.S. intervention in Venezuela.\n\nEven though Russian officials never made a formal offer, Moscow's then-ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, hinted many times to her that Russia was willing to allow the United States to act as it wished in Venezuela if the U.S. did the same for Russia in Europe, Hill told The Associated Press this week.\n\nRead more about the former adviser's remarks\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021, there is no official event to memorialize what happened that day, when the mob made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue, battled police at the Capitol barricades and stormed inside, as lawmakers fled. The political parties refuse to agree on a shared history of the events, which were broadcast around the globe. And the official plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol has never been hung.\n\nInstead, the day displayed the divisions that still define Washington, and the country, and the White House itself issued a glossy new report with its own revised history of what happened.\n\nTrump, during a lengthy morning speech to House Republicans away from the Capitol at the rebranded Kennedy Center now carrying his own name, shifted blame for Jan. 6 onto the rioters themselves. Democrats meanwhile reconvened members of the House committee that investigated the attack for a panel discussion to prevent what Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., described as the GOP's \"Orwellian project of forgetting.\"\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack\n\nDenmark and Greenland are seeking a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio after the Trump administration doubled down on its intention to take over the strategic Arctic island, a Danish territory.\n\nThis weekend's U.S. military action in Venezuela has heightened fears across Europe, and Trump and his advisers in recent days have reiterated the U.S. leader's desire to take over the island, which guards the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America.\n\n\"It's so strategic right now,\" Trump told reporters Sunday.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart, Vivian Motzfeldt, have requested the meeting with Rubio in the near future, according to a statement posted Tuesday to Greenland's government website.\n\nPrevious requests for a sit-down were not successful, the statement said.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about Trump's interest in Greenland\n\nTrump said Tuesday that the nation would provide 30 to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., pledging to use proceeds from the sale of this oil \"to benefit the people\" of both countries.

This initiative has generated significant negative coverage (29 articles from 28 sources, average sentiment -0.28) and strong opposition from Denmark and Greenland, raising concerns about the stability of the NATO alliance. The situation is unfolding rapidly, with Denmark and Greenland seeking dialogue with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nThe primary driver for the U.S. appears to be securing access to Greenland\u2019s strategic location, as emphasized by President Trump\u2019s statements. Simultaneously, the U.S. is involved in securing oil supplies from Venezuela, with repeated mentions of 50,000,000 barrels of oil being provided or to be provided. Stakeholder positions are sharply divided, with Mette Frederiksen warning of the end of NATO, while Delcy Rodr\u00edguez promotes Venezuelan investment. The situation also involves U.S. military actions, such as boarding a Venezuela-linked oil tanker.",
