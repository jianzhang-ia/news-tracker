      "title": "Trump Pulls Out of Global Climate Treaty",
      "body": "President Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that the United States would withdraw from the bedrock international agreement that forms the basis for countries to rein in climate change.\n\nThe agreement, which has been in place for 34 years, counts all of the other nations of the world as members.\n\nMr. Trump announced the decision as part of presidential memorandum withdrawing the United States from a raft of international organizations and treaties that the administration claimed no longer serve American interests, the White House said in a social media post.\n\nThe decision not only sends a powerful signal of America's withdrawal from global diplomacy and leadership, but is a finger in the eye to the billions of people, including Americans, suffering intensifying wildfires, storms and droughts, threats to the food supply and to biodiversity, and other dangerous and costly effects of a warming planet.\n\nThe move sealed the United States' isolation in the world on climate action. The agreement, officially known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, was established in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Known by its acronym, UNFCCC, it was the foundation for the Paris agreement a decade ago, a voluntary pact among nations to slow down global temperature increases to relatively reasonable levels.\n\nMr. Trump has already moved to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement. That will become official on Jan. 20.\n\nPresident Trump's retreat on climate cooperation comes as the United States' main rival on the world stage, China, has come to dominate the clean energy technologies of the future. At the same time, many of the United States' most powerful allies, including Australia, Britain and the European Union, are also advancing their ambitions to reduce emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases and ramp up renewable energies.\n\n\"The world's most phenomenal geopolitical player, its largest economy, its second largest emitter, is basically checking out,\" the European Union's climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, said in a recent interview referring to the U.S. posture on the Paris agreement.\n\nThe withdrawal would take a year to go into effect once the U.S. files a formal notice with the United Nations. Once finalized, the U.S. would no longer take part in annual negotiations among 200 nations aimed at encouraging countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"It sends a major signal around the world of U.S. disdain for climate policy that's essential for the world,\" said Jean Galbraith, a professor specializing in international law at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.\n\nThe U.S. Senate ratified the U.N. climate treaty unanimously in 1992. A president's legal authority to unilaterally withdraw from a treaty is questionable, and the Supreme Court has never definitively ruled on the issue.\n\nAnd yet as a practical matter, past presidents have been able to do so. When President George W. Bush withdrew the U.S. from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, for example, only a few members of Congress objected.\n\nSome legal scholars have said withdrawing from the U.N. climate framework would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to return under a future president without another Senate vote.\n\nOthers, including Ms. Galbraith said a future president could bring the U.S. back into the treaty relatively easily. The two-thirds Senate vote that took place in 1992 remains in effect, she said, and doesn't get nullified if a president walks away from the agreement.\n\nThe decision to withdraw is part of an aggressive assault on climate efforts by President Trump. His administration has rolled back climate regulations, removed scientific data on climate change from government websites, thwarted the development of wind and solar energy and commissioned a federal report downplaying the effects of a warming planet.\n\nIn February he instructed the State Department to review U.S. support for all global agreements and organizations, including the U.N. climate framework. The White House imposed a 180-day deadline for that review, which expired in early August.\n\nNo other country has followed the United States' lead in pulling out of the Paris deal. It remains unclear whether the exit from the underlying convention would inspire other countries to follow suit.\n\nSomini Sengupta is the international climate reporter on the Times climate team.",

Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the latest effort by Trump and his allies to distance the U.S. from international organizations focused on climate and addressing climate change.\n\nUNFCC, the 1992 agreement between 198 countries to financially support climate change activities in developing countries, is the underlying treaty for the landmark Paris climate agreement. Trump -- who calls climate change a hoax -- withdrew from that agreement soon after reclaiming the White House.\n\nMainstream scientists say climate change is behind increasing instances of deadly and costly extreme weather, including flooding, droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and dangerous heat.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal could hinder global efforts to curb greenhouse gases because it \"gives other nations the excuse to delay their own actions and commitments,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIt also will be difficult to achieve meaningful progress on climate change without cooperation from the U.S., one of the world's largest emitters and economies, experts said.\n\nThe U.N.'s population agency, which provides sexual and reproductive health across the world, has long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition and Trump himself cut funding for the agency during his first term in office. He and other GOP officials have accused the agency of participating in \"coercive abortion practices\" in countries like China.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, he restored funding for the agency. A State Department review conducted the following year found no evidence to support these claims.\n\nOther organizations and agencies that the U.S. will quit include the Carbon Free Energy Compact, the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the Pan-American Institute for Geography and History, the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.\n\nThe State Department said additional reviews are ongoing.\n\n___\n\nAmiri reported from the United Nations.

  "executive_brief": "President Donald Trump has initiated a withdrawal of the United States from 66 international organizations, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This action, covered by 12 articles from 12 sources, represents a significant retreat from global cooperation and is overwhelmingly viewed negatively (average sentiment score: -0.55). The scale of the withdrawal, encompassing a broad range of agencies and commissions, signals a substantial shift in U.S. foreign policy. \n\nStakeholder positions are sharply divided. Donald Trump views many organizations as wasteful or against U.S. interests, repeatedly stating \u201cclimate change is a hoax.\u201d Opposing voices, such as Wopke Hoekstra of the European Union, express concern that the U.S. withdrawal weakens global efforts, with Hoekstra stating the U.S. is \u201cbasically checking out.\u201d While there are no significant financial mentions, the data suggests China is positioned to benefit from the U.S. withdrawal in clean energy technologies. The United Nations is forced to respond with staffing and program cuts, and Joe Biden\u2019s initial restoration of funding is now superseded by this withdrawal.",
