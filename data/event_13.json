      "title": "EV Dreams Delayed: Why Hybrids Are Suddenly Hot Again",
      "body": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nIndustry observers suggest the global transition to zero-emission vehicles is unfolding more slowly than many policymakers and automakers once anticipated, prompting a reassessment of how road transport decarbonization could realistically progress. Recent policy signals from Europe appear to support that view. In December, the European Union moved away from a quasi-ban on combustion-engine cars planned for 2035 and instead positioned hybrid vehicles as part of its pathway toward net-zero emissions by 2050. That shift implies regulators are increasingly open to transitional technologies as they balance climate ambitions with consumer affordability and infrastructure readiness.\n\nFrom the demand side, analysts note that hybrids are gaining traction as fully electric vehicles struggle to broaden their appeal beyond early adopters. EV-focused manufacturers led by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped drive rapid adoption earlier in the decade, but from around 2023, growth has faced headwinds as price sensitivity, range limitations, charging availability and battery longevity concerns weighed on buyers, particularly in Western markets. Hybrids, which pair internal combustion engines with electric motors and smaller batteries, are being viewed by many consumers as a lower-cost way to reduce emissions without changing refueling behavior. Against that backdrop, Western automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Volkswagen have been reallocating capital toward hybrids, while Asian manufacturers like Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Honda (NYSE:HMC), which maintained a multi-pathway strategy, appear increasingly aligned with shifting consumer preferences, especially in parts of southern Europe.\n\nAt the same time, analysts caution that the environmental case for hybrids remains under scrutiny, particularly for plug-in models. Advocacy group Transport & Environment has pointed to data suggesting plug-in hybrids emit about 19% less CO2 per kilometer than petrol and diesel cars on average, with real-world emissions substantially higher than official test results indicate. BloombergNEF has said the EU is in the process of updating its vehicle emissions testing regime, a development that could influence how many hybrids manufacturers are permitted to sell depending on measured emissions performance. As a result, while hybrids could play a more durable role in the transition than previously expected, their regulatory treatment and long-term positioning remain subject to evolving policy and data outcomes.",

      "title": "Future of driving takes an unexpected turn, as gas cars get a new boost",
      "body": "BRUSSELS -- The gasoline-powered car is outlasting the policies that had aimed to banish it.\n\nThe latest example of the combustion engine's staying power came Tuesday, when the European Union said it would back away from a landmark pledge to ban emissions from new vehicles in 2035. That announcement came one day after Ford said it would scale back electric vehicle production plans, joining a long list of American and European automakers to rethink climate strategies.\n\nThose retreats, taken together, show that the full-on electric transition is far less certain than it might have looked several years ago -- and that polluting cars and trucks could remain on roads across Europe and America for decades to come. The moves also sharpen the contrast between the West and China, which has developed a massive and lucrative EV market supplied by state-backed automakers.\n\nIn the United States, where President Donald Trump has portrayed electric cars as an expensive \"scam,\" the White House has cut EV incentives and this month announced plans to weaken fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks.\n\nEuropean officials say they favor a future that is mostly electric, and many countries still have EV incentives in place. But Brussels faced intense pressure from the continent's automakers to dilute the 2035 ban. Those legacy carmakers, with huge workforces and factories built around combustion engines, have struggled to compete with China's low-cost, high-quality EVs.\n\nThe revised proposal will force carmakers to meet 90% fleetwide emissions reductions compared with 2021 levels. That means most vehicles will be fully electric. But it also leaves room for hybrids -- including those with a plug-in option -- and gas-powered vehicles.\n\nFerdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, the director of the Center Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany, said he sees the world's auto industry splitting into three parts -- one in the United States, fully supportive of gas cars; one in China, all in on EVs; and another in Europe, where policies are now muddled. He said Chinese automakers are likely to benefit most from that dynamic because the Chinese market dwarfs those in the U.S. and Europe and looks to keep growing -- and electrifying.\n\nAmerican and European markets have had a hard time splitting from the gas-powered vehicles because combustion engines have higher profit margins. But that strategy leaves them in a long-term bind.\n\n\"In the future, China will define the rules of the car industry,\" Dudenh\u00f6ffer said.\n\nWith a license to keep producing gas vehicles, he said, Western manufacturers \"earn some kind of short-term windfall. But in the long term, they lose a lot. The advantages of the Chinese carmakers will be larger and larger.\"\n\nFord, in its announcement, said it was seeking out \"higher-return opportunities\" by expanding gas and hybrid options. It said it would produce a gas-powered pickup truck at a Tennessee plant while putting a hold on production of its flagship EV, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nCarmakers such as Volvo and Porsche have also pulled back from more ambitious EV plans. Earlier this year, Stellantis, which includes the Jeep and Fiat brands, shifted away from plans to be fully electric in Europe by 2030.\n\nThe gas vehicle ban had been a core component of Europe's much-heralded climate plan, introduced four years ago as officials cited the \"generational task\" of saving the planet. At the time, E.U. leaders said they had put the continent's car industry -- which accounts for 7% of Europe's gross domestic product -- at the forefront of innovation by creating a clear future target.\n\nBut large automakers -- including Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and BMW -- have seen their market values nosedive. In a strategic error, the EVs they produced tended to be high-end, not for the mass market. In the meantime, leaders in Germany and Italy described the 2035 target as a danger to European jobs.\n\n\"Such a hard cutoff in 2035 will not take place, if I have anything to do with it,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had said.",

      "title": "EU rows back on 2035 zero emissions targets",
      "body": "The EU has proposed allowing hybrid cars remaining on sale beyond the planned 2035 deadline for 100% zero-emission vehicles, relaxing the targets for manufacturers.\n\nThe latest European Commission Automotive Package, revealed on 16 December 2025, is a result of market analysis, progress and feedback from manufacturers and governments including data from the UK's ZEV Mandate consultation in early 2025.\n\nAs anticipated, the package highlights slower than expected progress towards the target of 100% reduction in tailpipe emissions by 2035 and proposes revisions that would allow manufacturers to continue offering a small number of fossil-fuel vehicles.\n\nThe revised target of 90% reduction in fleet tailpipe CO2 emissions by 2035 is an obvious backtracking on the deadline imposed previously, but manufacturers gain more in the small print and adjustment of targets during the transition period.\n\nFirst among the revisions is a new 'super-credit' for small, affordable zero-emission vehicles made within the EU. These are the transferable credits that manufacturers can use to offset failure to meet CO2 targets elsewhere in the range, or the number of ZEVs (zero emission vehicles) registered in a given year.\n\nThe made in the European Union part of the proposal is clearly aimed at slowing the influx of cheap EVs from China, though some are either branded by, or distributed by, existing EU manufacturers.\n\nA new initiative for 'small affordable cars' covers electric vehicles below 4.2 metres in length, making it easier for taxation and other incentives for governments promote these vehicles.\n\nBanking and borrowing credits will be extended to 2030-2032, making sales of these small EVs particularly beneficial to European brands\n\nOne of the hardest goals to achieve is decarbonisation of commercial vehicles. Strict targets for lower emission vans and greater numbers of zero-emission vehicles in the commercial sector have not been met. As a result the target for reduced fleet tailpipe emissions in 2030 will be adjusted from 50% to 40%.\n\nA package of incentives and reliefs for battery production in Europe will also boost development, including \u20ac1.5bn in interest-free loans for battery cell production.\n\nEU regulations do not directly impact the UK, but type approval and emissions targets are harmonised and UK factories and supply chains will potentially benefit from the additional time for new technologies to be developed.\n\nIt's almost certain that when EU member states vote on the proposals they will pass - and the UK's legislation will follow suit or even adjust the allowances further in the knowledge that manufacturers will be producing hybrid and combustion-powered vehicles for longer.",

      "title": "EU Set to Weaken 2035 Internal Combustion Engine Ban",
      "body": "The European Union has officially announced plans to change the 2035 emissions laws due to pressure from automakers.\n\nEurope's 2035 emissions laws are set to be revised, with the latest proposal in the European Parliament allowing for a limited number of vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) to be sold. Previously, the emissions laws stated that all new light vehicles sold could not \"emit any carbon dioxide (exhaust) emissions\"; practically banning the sale of all vehicles employing ICEs from 2035. The latest proposal essentially states that 90% of all new vehicles should be fully-electric, with the remaining 10% being those of the hybrid variety. Although this would not affect vehicles already on the road, automakers that exceed their fleet emissions target would be liable to pay financial penalties.\n\nThe European Union (EU) plans for the transport sector to become carbon-neutral by 2050. The year 2035 was chosen for the updated emissions laws to become effective, given the average 15-year lifespan of a vehicle in Europe. 90% of vehicles in Europe are expected to be electric by 2035, according to the EC.\n\nOther efforts to offset emissions from ICE-powered vehicles include the use of synthetic and low-emissions fuel as well as '\"green steel\" production. Incentives in the form of \"super credits\" will be issued for small battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) produced in Europe to prevent an influx of Chinese EVs.\n\nAccording to reports from Automotive News, the changes are expected to be presented by the European Commission (EC) to the European Parliament in 2026. The European Automakers Manufacturers' Union was the primary driver of the changes, noting a slower-than-expected uptake of BEVs and a lack of charging infrastructure, which they identified as key factors; warning that a 100% EV target would result in penalties reaching the billions.",

      "body": "\"What was approved yesterday constitutes a historic mistake for Europe, because competitiveness is ensured by sustainability, not by loosening our commitments,\" he said during a climate conference in Madrid.\n\nThe combustion-engine ban was hailed as a major win in the fight against climate change when adopted in 2023.\n\nSpain, France and the Nordic countries warned that ditching the commitment risked slowing the shift to electric vehicles, undermining the EU's green agenda and deterring investments in electrification.\n\nBut carmakers and their backers have lobbied hard over the past year for Brussels to relax the ban, in the face of fierce competition from China and a slower-than-expected shift to electric vehicles.\n\nUnder proposals decried by environmental groups, carmakers will now have to cut exhaust emissions from new vehicles by 90 percent from 2021 levels -- down from an envisaged 100 percent -- with the remainder \"compensated\" in various ways.\n\nSpain is Europe's second-largest car producer after Germany.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz has hailed the EU's new proposals, saying \"more openness to technology and greater flexibility are the right steps\".\n\nEU moves to support carmakers: What are the main measures?\n\nStrasbourg, France (AFP) Dec 16, 2025 - The EU unveiled on Tuesday a package of measures to support its embattled carmakers in the face of fierce competition from China and a slower-than-expected shift to electric vehicles.\n\nFrom watering down a 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars to requiring companies to buy low-emission vehicles, here are the main proposals put forward by the European Commission:\n\n- Banned no more -\n\nThe EU will weaken a 2035 ban on new cars with internal combustion engines.\n\nCarmakers will now have to cut exhaust emissions from new vehicles by 90 percent from 2021 levels.\n\nIn practice, they will be allowed to sell a limited amount of polluting vehicles -- from plug-in hybrids to diesel cars -- past 2035, under stringent conditions.\n\nThe emissions produced by these vehicles will need to be offset by two types of carbon credits\n\nThe first will be generated by the use of made-in-Europe, low-carbon steel and the second tied to the amount of e-fuels and biofuels that energy companies put on the market every year.\n\n- Green corporate fleets -\n\nTo boost EV sales, companies with more than 250 employees or 50 million euros ($59 million) in revenue, including car rental firms, will be required to green their fleets.\n\nEvery EU country will have a target for its businesses to purchase a minimum share of zero- or low-emission vehicles when renewing their fleets.\n\nThe baseline will be around 30 percent, according to commission officials, with the bar set higher for richer nations.\n\nCorporate fleets account for about 60 percent of new cars sold in Europe.\n\n- Support for battery makers -\n\nBrussels will provide 1.5 billion euros in interest-free loans to support European battery producers, which struggle to compete in a market dominated by China.\n\n- Small European EVs -\n\nThe commission set out measures to boost production and sales of small, \"affordable\" EVs defined as cars shorter than 4.2 meters in length.\n\nSuch vehicles, when made in the EU, will grant carmakers \"super credits\" in the run-up to 2035.\n\nIn an accounting trick that would make reaching emission targets easier, small EVs will be counted 1.3 times, thus artificially boosting the share of zero-emission vehicles in automakers' fleets.\n\nThese cars will also come under a new labelling category that will allow EU countries and local authorities to develop targeted incentives to stimulate uptake.\n\n- Support for 'Made in Europe' -\n\nThe commission said it wants to introduce a \"European preference\" pushing manufacturers that receive public subsidies to source components from within the bloc.\n\nCarbon credits linked to low-carbon steel produced in Europe, as well as support measures for the battery industry, go in this direction and further measures are expected to be put forward early next year.\n\n- Vans and trucks -\n\nThe commission proposed reducing the interim 2030 emission target for vans from 50 to 40 percent and allowing truck manufacturers more time to meet their own 2030 target, in line with a previous concession to automakers.\n\nThis comes as EV sales in both categories have been lagging behind.",

      "body": "\u25ba Official: EU drops 2035 combustion ban\n\n\u25ba Emissions to be reduced by 90 per cent\n\n\u25ba Includes other means of decarbonising car industry\n\nAfter months of speculation, lobbying and even a few talkative MEPs, the European Commission has officially confirmed that its combustion engine ban that would come into effect in 2035 has been scrapped.\n\nInstead, the Commission has announced that a 90 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions will be the rule for passenger cars instead - still a significant reduction. The remaining 10 per cent will be reduced or removed via 'compensation mechanisms' like using 'low-carbon' steel manufactured in the European Union, or engineering the engines to run on biofuels or synthetic fuels.\n\nBeyond 2035, the EU Commission says that 'Plug-in hybrids, range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal combustion engine vehicles will still play a role, in addition to full electric (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles.'\n\nThere was also tacit confirmation of a plan for a new type of 'small affordable electric car' class, with the EU pointing out that manufacturing these kinds of vehicles will allow car makers to 'make a larger contribution to CO2 target compliance through 'super credits.''\n\nThis new class of small car, nicknamed the E-Car, has already been mooted by EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. During her 2025 State of the Union speech on 10 September, she said: 'Millions of Europeans want to buy affordable European cars, so we should also invest in small, affordable vehicles. I believe Europe should have its own E-Car. E for 'environmental', 'economical' and 'European.''\n\nCars like the Dacia Hipster hit a lucky break when that statement was made, as this new 'E-Car' vehicle class could be just the right solution for that car to make production as close to the concept as possible. Stellantis, too, is investigating this E-Car program, having lobbied the EU just as much as the Renault Group has.\n\nCommentators point out that this is a win for China. The argument is that in a market where EVs are dominant, China already has a leg-up; reducing the mandatory requirements in Europe for other car makers reduces the need to innovate and could leave them further behind. A repeal or watering down of the ban was also lobbied against by the likes of Volvo and Polestar (below), according to The Guardian.\n\nClimate campaigners also see this as a significant rollback. Dominic Phinn, head of transport at Climate Group said via Reuters that this is a 'tragic win' for conventional combustion engine use. 'The watering down of the petrol and diesel-engine phase-out flies in the face of leading companies across Europe, who are investing billions in electric fleets and desperately need the stability it provides,' he says.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that this, for now at least, doesn't affect the UK's plans. Its ZEV Mandate is entirely separate to the EU's own emissions rules and, given we're not in the European Union, we're not obliged to follow this new rule set.",

      "title": "Volkswagen Warns Small Gas Cars Are Doomed",
      "body": "Automakers are breathing a sigh of relief now that the European Commission is proposing to reverse the 2035 sales ban on new vehicles with combustion engines. However, companies will still have to slash fleet emissions by 90 percent compared to 2021 levels. Even before the middle of the next decade, manufacturers must meet tighter CO\u2082 targets, the latest of which came into effect this year. From 2030 onward, the rules of the game will become even stricter.\n\nWith that in mind, Volkswagen is warning that small gas-powered cars have no future in Europe. The CEO of Europe's best-selling brand told Auto Motor und Sport that models such as the Polo will go purely electric. Thomas Sch\u00e4fer calls it as he sees it: \"The future in this segment is electric.\" Developing a new ICE car in the B-segment to comply with emissions regulations would be prohibitively expensive. Those costs would inevitably be passed on to customers, making the car too costly to compete.\n\nConsequently, it's only a matter of time before the supermini loses its combustion engine altogether, leaving the ID. Polo to serve as its indirect successor. A return to the A-segment with a gas-powered car in the mold of the tiny up! or the Lupo is also off the table. This decision is a no-brainer given the upcoming influx of relatively affordable EVs. The electric Polo arriving next year will cost \u20ac25,000 in its basic configuration.\n\nIn 2027, a production version of the ID. Every1 concept will lower the entry price to \u20ac20,000. Both figures include value-added tax (VAT) but do not account for incentives offered by some EU member states. VW is also planning a Polo-sized electric crossover, previewed months ago at the IAA Mobility Show by the ID. Cross concept. All three models will ride on the MEB+ platform, developed exclusively for electric vehicles.\n\nAlthough VW won't invest in new small cars powered by combustion engines, the current crop of ICE models will stick around. Wolfsburg has not set an end date for the Polo or its crossover sibling, the T-Cross. Gas and electric vehicles will run in parallel for an unspecified period before conventionally powered models are dropped from the lineup.\n\nLooking at the most recent sales figures, VW is by far the most popular automaker in the EU. It's the only brand to surpass one million sales after the first ten months of 2025. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reports 1,017,781 units sold. When factoring in the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, the total rises to 1,208,829 vehicles.\n\nAlthough some have hastily claimed that EV demand is cooling, the figures tell a different story, at least in Europe. Through October, electric cars accounted for 16.4 percent of the EU market, up from 13.2 percent in the same period last year. Including the non-EU countries mentioned earlier, EVs held an 18.3 percent share through October. Last year, vehicles without a combustion engine accounted for 14.8 percent of the region's market. VW's new affordable electric models are likely to play a significant role in driving EV demand in the coming years.",

      "title": "Europe ditches its 2035 engine ban, will the U.S. follow?",
      "body": "Europe's long-planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars is no longer as clear-cut as it once seemed. Recent policy shifts and growing political pushback have reopened the door for gas-powered vehicles, signaling a major recalibration of the continent's all-electric ambitions. For automakers and consumers alike, this change could have far-reaching consequences for product planning, pricing, and the pace of electrification.\n\nThe move reflects mounting concerns over affordability, charging infrastructure gaps, and the real-world readiness of EV adoption at scale. Several European governments have argued that a hard cutoff risks alienating buyers and straining industries that are still deeply tied to combustion technology. As a result, exemptions, delays, and alternative fuels are now back on the table, softening what was once seen as an inevitable deadline.\n\nThat raises an obvious question across the Atlantic. The U.S. has pursued aggressive emissions targets of its own, but it has also shown a willingness to adapt when market realities clash with regulation. With consumer demand, political pressure, and automaker lobbying all in flux, Europe's reversal could become a preview of how America handles its own combustion-engine future.\n\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including the EPA, Bild, and Reuters.\n\nRelated The ultra-reliable Japanese sports car you can get for under $25K\n\nYou don't need a big budget to drive this sports car that rarely needs repairs.\n\nPosts 1 By Tyler Dupont The combustion engine will live a little longer in Europe\n\nAfter a long battle, and much debate, Europe has finally agreed to loosen the deadline on the combustion engine ban in Europe. Previously, no new combustion engines would be able to be sold past 2035. However, a number of factors have slowed the growth of electric vehicles and more and more automakers are finding themselves having to invest in combustion engines again.\n\nWhere do they stand now?\n\nInstead of having to reduce emissions by 100 percent beyond 2035, automakers in Europe will now have to reduce emissions by 90 percent. While this doesn't seem like a lot of wiggle room, it means that hybrids and range-extended EVs will be able to continue existing past the deadline, which should make the transition smoother. We also doubt this will be the last time that regulations will be loosened.\n\nFor new registrations from 2035 onwards, a 90-percent reduction in CO2 emissions will now be mandatory for car manufacturers' fleet targets, instead of 100 percent. There will also be no 100-percent target from 2040 onwards. This means that the technology ban on combustion engines is off the table. All engines currently built in Germany can therefore continue to be produced and sold.\n\nManfred Weber, Head of the European People's Party\n\nThe above is a quote from the head of the EPP to German newspaper Bild. There has been a lot of pushback from automotive brands in Europe, such as the Volkswagen Group and Stellantis, with them claiming the previous goals were going to be too difficult to meet. They will now be given a three-year window between 2030 and 2033 to reduce emissions by 55 percent compared to 2021's numbers.\n\nMany reasons for the ban's collapse\n\nEven before automakers began the shift back towards combustion engines, the ban just wasn't feasible. While electric vehicles are fantastic and really important, they are still fairly new. Expecting automakers and consumers to bear the brunt of new technology and infrastructure in such a short space of time was too high of a bar. The charging network isn't yet vast or robust enough to support everyone in Europe.\n\nAt the current moment, electric vehicles are still pretty expensive to make in Europe. Even with subsidies, EVs are simply more expensive than gas-powered cars. Budgets are tightening around the world, and people can't be expected to shell out more money to support European EVs. Affordability is a massive factor in why a ban like this simply doesn't take into account the needs of the people.\n\nRelated This used American luxury sedan delivers Lexus-grade reliability\n\nFor the price of a new Camry, you could drive this sturdy luxury sedan instead.\n\nPosts 1 By Tyler Dupont The United States faces an equally complex set of challenges\n\nWhile there is no federal ban proposed, a number of states, led by California, followed the example set by Europe by establishing a proposed ban on combustion engine vehicles by 2035. The question is whether we will see a similar rollback in the United States after Europe has rolled back their ban.\n\nRegulatory pressure is intense\n\nEven without the presence of a ban, things like emissions regulations, fuel economy standards, and the influence of states like California have been pushing automakers into EV heavy lineups. For a long time, federal incentives further pushed the consumer in that direction, offering tax credits if you bought electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Things are changing, though, and public sentiment around EVs is on a downwards trend.\n\nEurope loosening the noose on combustion engines could embolden opposition to these regulations. We've already seen some strong stances being taken, and we could see even further pushes for combustion power to stick around. The current administration ended the long-running $7,500 tax credit for buying an EV a couple of months ago, and this could usher in even more changes.\n\nConsumers still favor ICE and hybrids\n\nModel\n\nUnits sold in 2025 (up to Q3)\n\nFord F-Series\n\n597,546\n\nChevrolet Silverado\n\n422,685\n\nToyota RAV4\n\n358,134\n\nHonda CR-V\n\n307,501\n\nRam Pickup\n\n262,386\n\nAbove are the top five best-selling nameplates in the United States. The best-selling electric vehicle, based on estimates, is the Tesla Model Y, which barely breaks the top ten with 232,000 units moved. The Model Y is also an outlier. The Tesla Model 3 breaks 100,000 units sold this year so far, but beyond that, no other even makes it to the six-figure mark.\n\nAmerica's car culture is unique\n\nWhen it comes to cars, the needs and wants of Americans are very different to those of Europeans. Americans like large vehicles that go long distances, and public transport isn't as popular overall. The limitations of EVs already put them at odds with a large portion of the American public. The technology needs time to evolve and bridge those gaps.\n\nInfrastructure is growing pretty rapidly, but it remains a pretty large issue when it comes to EVs in America. Large portions of the country lack access to fast charging networks. This makes full electrification a pretty hard sell outside major metros. All this context plays a large role in whether or not the adoption of these policies will actually work in the United States.\n\nThe future may still be electric, but the path there needs to be realistic\n\nWe still think that the mass adoption of EVs is the way that the automotive market is heading. For better or for worse, they are friendly to the environment and to the consumer in the long run. However, these all-or-nothing policies simply aren't realistic. The path to electrification needs to be gradual, allowing infrastructure and technology to keep up with the needs of the consumer. The lift of the 2035 ban in Europe will ultimately give their automotive sector a fighting chance. A similar attitude in the United States is definitely the way to go.",

      "body": "Electric vehicle transition slows globally, but South Korea risks moving too fast\n\nFor much of the past decade, the global car industry has been hurtling down a single-track road toward a purely electric future. The destination once seemed fixed. It was a total ban on the internal combustion engine by 2035, a date that came to resemble a high-speed deadline for the end of the petroleum age.\n\nNow, however, the lead car in this race is tapping the brakes. The European Union's recent signal that it may revise its landmark 2035 ban is more than a technical correction. It marks a shift away from rigid insistence on zero tailpipe emissions toward industrial realism.\n\nUnder the proposed revision, Brussels is considering a legislative climbdown that would replace the total prohibition with a 90 percent reduction target. Carmakers would be allowed to continue selling combustion models, including hybrids and diesel vehicles, up to 10 percent of their 2021 emission levels.\n\nThe move comes as Europe's auto champions are under acute strain. Volkswagen is closing domestic plants for the first time in its 88-year history. German and Italian policymakers have warned of further layoffs if compliance pressure remains unchanged.\n\nEuropean manufacturers have also found themselves outmaneuvered by a surge of low-cost Chinese EVs, often priced 40 percent below European counterparts. This widening price gap has turned the green transition into a potential Trojan horse for foreign market dominance.\n\nPolitical pressure helped drive this recalibration. Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has publicly backed a more flexible approach to the 2035 combustion engine ban, arguing that electric mobility should remain central while other technologies, such as synthetic fuels, retain a role in meeting climate goals. His stance reflects growing concern over the competitiveness of the bloc's auto sector.\n\nThe slowdown is not confined to Europe. In the US, the Trump administration eliminated the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles in October and has since weakened fuel efficiency standards introduced under the previous administration, offering relief to legacy manufacturers such as Ford and GM.\n\nMajor carmakers have responded accordingly. Ford, GM and Stellantis are scaling back electric ambitions and leaning more heavily on hybrids and conventional engines. The much-discussed EV chasm, the gap between early adopters and mass consumers, has widened as charging infrastructure lags and costs remain high.\n\nAmid this global recalibration, South Korea remains stuck in high gear. Seoul's recently finalized 2035 national greenhouse gas reduction goal, known as the nationally determined contribution, targets a cut of 53 to 61 percent from 2018 levels. Meeting that objective effectively requires zero-emission vehicles to account for 70 percent of all new sales within a decade.\n\nThe ambition is admirable, but the risks are substantial. More than 10,000 domestic parts suppliers remain tied to combustion engines. An abrupt transition could hollow out the supply chain before alternatives are viable.\n\nThere is also a strategic vulnerability. Strict domestic regulations may clear the path for low-cost Chinese EVs to dominate the Korean market while local manufacturers are still retooling. Infrastructure constraints compound the challenge. Charging networks and grid capacity, already bottlenecks in Europe, pose similar limits at home.\n\nNone of this argues for abandoning decarbonization. Transportation remains a major source of emissions, and delay carries its own costs. But Seoul needs to recalibrate its policy pace to match the torque of reality. The green transition is a marathon, not a drag race, and even the front-runners in Brussels and Washington are now searching for pit stops.\n\nSouth Korea should respond with a more flexible roadmap and a multipath strategy that includes hybrids and carbon-neutral fuels, aligning climate ambition with economic resilience.\n\nDownshifting now may be the surest way to avoid leaving the domestic economy idling in the rearview mirror.",

      "title": "EU backtracking on its Green Deal",
      "body": "Economic and worries about competitiveness has led the EU to soften its Green Deal rules. / bne IntelliNews\n\nThe European Commission is preparing to scale back one of its most ambitious climate pledges as it seeks to relieve pressure on its lacklustre economy. The commission announced this week that it will drop plans for a complete ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles from 2035.\n\nThe shift reflects growing concern among governments and industry that targets agreed in the early 2020s are colliding with economic, geopolitical and competitiveness realities -- a dynamic increasingly visible not only in the ongoing deindustrialisation that started in Germany, but is now spreading to the agriculture sector.\n\nThe ban on combustion engines law, adopted in 2022, stipulated that from 2035 all new passenger cars and vans sold in the EU must produce zero carbon dioxide emissions. In practice, this amounted to a ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles and a requirement for a full transition to battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell models, a cornerstone of the bloc's plan to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nAgriculture, which was expected to deliver parallel emissions reductions through lower fertiliser use, pesticide cuts and land-use changes, has been subject to similarly rigid targets under the Green Deal that has been the signature initiative for the last decade.\n\nClimate rules softened\n\nDespite the roll back, Brussels insists it is not abandoning its climate goals. According to reports by the Financial Times and Reuters, the Commission is instead preparing to adjust the mechanism underpinning the car ban, that the industry hated.\n\nUnder revised proposals, carmakers would no longer be required to eliminate CO\u2082 emissions entirely. Residual emissions of up to 10% of 2021 levels could be permitted, provided strict conditions are met. A comparable shift has already taken place in farming, where the Commission has eased environmental conditions attached to Common Agricultural Policy subsidies and withdrawn a proposal to halve pesticide use by 2030 following widespread opposition.\n\n\"Farmers are not against sustainability, but the pace and scale of these targets are disconnected from economic reality,\" said Pekka Pesonen, Secretary General of Copa-Cogeca, which represents EU farmers and cooperatives, in comments reported by Reuters. \"If policies are not adjusted, production will simply move outside Europe.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the automotive discussions say the new conditions would include the use of low-carbon materials, particularly green steel, and the production of extended-range electric vehicles, which rely primarily on batteries but include a small internal combustion engine as a backup power source. Reuters has also reported that officials are discussing extending the effective ban by five years or softening it indefinitely, a move that would mark the EU's most significant retreat from its climate agenda in recent years.\n\nIn agriculture, farmer groups argue that similar flexibility is needed on fertiliser use and crop rotation rules, warning that rigid mandates risk undermining food security.\n\nIn March, the Commission had already granted automakers a three-year grace period to meet separate CO\u2082 reduction targets originally due by 2025, signalling a broader willingness to introduce flexibility. That decision followed months of protests by farmers across France, Germany, Poland, Italy and Belgium, where growers blocked roads and borders to demand relief from environmental regulations, they said were being implemented faster than markets and technology could adapt.\n\n\"We are being asked to do more with less, while competing with imports that do not follow the same rules,\" Arnaud Rousseau, head of France's FNSEA farm union, told Reuters during protests earlier this year. \"This is not a rejection of environmental goals, but a demand for fairness.\"\n\n\"It is a geopolitical moment and a complicated context,\" said Sara Aagesen, Spain's minister for the ecological transition. \"The Commission itself has already introduced flexibilities in the past.\"\n\nUnder the emerging automotive framework, tailpipe emissions would be required to fall by 90% by the middle of the next decade rather than the current target of a 100% reduction, according to people briefed on the talks. Carmakers would also need to compensate for additional pollution by using low-carbon or renewable fuels or locally produced green steel.\n\nAgricultural policymakers are pursuing similar offset-style approaches, emphasising soil carbon storage, precision farming and lower-emission fertilisers rather than blanket cuts to production.\n\n\"We believe that we must continue with that roadmap that was drawn up with the goal of ending the commercialization of combustion vehicles in 2035,\" Aagesen said. \"It is important to meet the commitments that have been defined in order to provide stability to investors and also to citizens.\"\n\nThe Commission declined to comment, but the proposal is expected to be adopted by EU commissioners this week before being sent to the European Parliament and the EU Council. Farm policy revisions, including changes to CAP conditionality, are also moving through the same legislative channels, with member states pressing for greater national discretion.\n\nGlobal green policy pullback\n\nThe policy rethink comes amid a wider global pullback from green transition targets, as governments confront the economic costs of rapid decarbonisation. In Europe, rising trade tensions with both the US and China have sharpened concerns about industrial competitiveness, highlighted by the report from former Italian Prime Minister and ex-European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi last year.\n\nIn agriculture, farmers have warned that EU producers face stricter environmental rules than overseas rivals, while imports produced under looser standards continue to enter the bloc.\n\nGermany has played a pivotal role in pushing for changes to the car ban. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has argued that a blanket prohibition on internal combustion engines from 2035 does not reflect market realities and has called for a \"technology-neutral\" approach, echoing the calls from the industry, including plug-in hybrids, synthetic fuels and advanced biofuels.\n\nBerlin has taken a similar stance in agriculture, backing demands for flexibility on fertiliser limits and land-use requirements. Italy and Poland supported Germany in a joint letter urging Brussels to abandon the outright automotive ban, with several central and eastern European countries also opposing it.\n\nThe automotive industry has added to the pressure. Electric vehicle sales in the EU are rebounding this year after a difficult 2024. According to industry body ACEA, EV sales rose by 38.6% between January and October, while hybrid sales increased by 9.4%. By contrast, agricultural producers continue to grapple with high input costs, particularly for fertilisers, where prices surged after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and remain volatile.\n\nThe recovery in car sales has been supported by more affordable models and new subsidy programmes, already in place in France and recently launched in Germany. Even so, automakers argue that the transition remains slower and less profitable than expected. Farmers make a similar case, saying sustainable practices often carry higher upfront costs without guaranteed returns, particularly as voluntary carbon credit schemes struggle to gain traction.\n\nEnvironmental groups warn that easing the rules risks creating loopholes that weaken Europe's climate ambitions. They have voiced the same concern in agriculture, arguing that rolling back pesticide and fertiliser targets could lock in emissions and biodiversity loss for decades.\n\n\"Weakening Green Deal measures in agriculture sends the wrong signal at the worst possible moment,\" Greenpeace EU said in a statement cited by Reuters, warning that delays could undermine the bloc's credibility on climate leadership.\n\nThe electric vehicle race is increasingly global. A third of the 39 countries where EVs account for more than 10% of new car sales in 2025 are now outside Europe, according to energy think-tank Ember. Agricultural markets are equally globalised, with food companies warning that unilateral EU standards risk shifting production -- and emissions -- abroad rather than eliminating them.\n\nEven so, the prospect of a 2035 ban triggered intense lobbying from groups including Stellantis NV and Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Farming organisations have mounted comparable campaigns, pressing Brussels to prioritise economic resilience and food security alongside climate objectives.\n\nAutomakers worldwide are struggling to make the transition pay. Ford Motor Co this week announced it would take $19.5bn in charges linked to a sweeping overhaul of its electric vehicle business. Across agriculture, governments are increasingly acknowledging similar trade-offs, as producers push for a slower, more flexible transition that mirrors the recalibration now under way in Europe's car industry.",

      "title": "EU scraps 2035 ICE ban, automotive industry divided in response",
      "body": "This announcement came as the European Commission presented an automotive package on December 16 aimed at supporting the sector's efforts in the transition to clean mobility. It follows several European leaders, including those from Germany, Italy and Hungary, writing to the commission urging for the 2035 ICE ban to be relaxed in the weeks leading up to this decision.\n\n\"Innovation, clean mobility, competitiveness - this year, these were top priorities in our intense dialogues with automotive sector, civil society organisations and stakeholders,\" commented Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission. \"And today, we are addressing them all together. As technology rapidly transforms mobility and geopolitics reshapes global competition, Europe remains at the forefront of the global clean transition.\"\n\nWith the plan to ban ICE vehicle sales by 2035 now scrapped, the EU will introduce a 90% tailpipe emissions reduction target, which European OEMs will have to comply with by 2035. The remaining 10%, the EU has said, will need to be compensated through the use of low-carbon steel made in the EU, or from e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nThe intention behind this is to allow ICE vehicles - as well as plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), mild hybrids and extended range electric vehicles (EREVs) to \"still play a role beyond 2035\", in addition to fully electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles.\n\nOne concern regarding the feasibility of a fully electric transformation in automotive supply chains is the availability of batteries. To address this as the industry transitions - albeit more gradually - towards electric vehicles, the European commission has unveiled the 'Battery Booster', a \u20ac1.8 billion ($2.1 billion) investment in accelerating e the development of a fully EU-made battery value chain.\n\nAccording to the commission, this investment will provide interest-free loans for European battery cell producers. Alongside this, the EU is set to introduce additional policy measures to \"support investments, create a European battery value chain and foster innovation and coordination across member states\".\n\nThese measures, it has said, will \"enhance the cost competitiveness of the sector, secure upstream supply chains and support sustainable and resilient production in the EU, contributing to the de-risking from dominant global market players\".\n\nWith Chinese OEMs entering the EV market in Europe benefitting from a stronger battery supply chain in China, ensuring a reliable supply of batteries in Europe to support the EV transition will be crucial to the competitiveness of European OEMs in the EV market.\n\nThe decision to scrap the 2035 ICE ban follows a trend already seen in the strategies of European OEMs - shifting away from ambitious all-electric targets to focus on a broader range of powertrains.\n\nWith the 2035 ICE ban a polarising subject in Europe, it is perhaps unsurprising that the automotive industry's reaction to the EU's latest announcement has been mixed.\n\nAccording to Reuters, a VW spokesperson described the proposal to drop the 2035 ICE ban as \"economically sound\", adding: \"Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions.\"\n\nSimilarly, a BMW spokesperson said: \"It is an important first step that the EU Commission no longer pursues technology bans as a guiding principle, but recognises the future viability of the combustion engine.\"\n\nMercedes-Benz described the move as \"a step in the right direction\" towards more flexibility for manufacturers and \"the necessary technological neutrality\", while Renault also welcomed the news, reassured that the EU's automotive package \"addresses some of the major challenges facing the European industry\".\n\nOn the other hand, Volvo Cars' response was less supportive of the decision. \"Weakening long-term commitments for short-term gain risks undermining Europe's competitiveness for years to come,\" a spokesperson said. \"A consistent and ambitious policy framework, as well as investments in public infrastructure, is what will deliver real benefits for customers, for the climate, and for Europe's industrial strength.\"\n\nThis is something Henner Lehne, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at S&P Global Mobility, drew attention to at the ALSC Europe conference in Bonn, Germany earlier this year. \"The reality is, electrification will come - it's just a matter of time,\" he said. \"But if you ignore it now in favour of short-term wins, you'll find yourself in real trouble in five years.\"\n\n\"Chinese OEMs have a long-term strategy,\" Lehne added. \"They will push, they will grind, and they are not thinking in two-year cycles - they are thinking in ten.\"\n\nStellantis also criticised the EU's decision. \"The proposals do not meaningfully address the issues that the industry is facing right now,\" a spokesperson said. \"Specifically, the package fails to provide a viable trajectory for the light commercial vehicles segment, which is in a critical situation, and the 2030 flexibilities requested by the industry for passenger cars.\"\n\nAs for industry associations, the reactions were equally as mixed. \"Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs, while China races further ahead,\" said William Todts, executive director of lobby group Transport & Environment (T&E). \"Clinging to combustion engines won't make European automakers great again.\"\n\nConversely, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) issued a statement in which it shared its view that the European Commission's automotive package is \"a first step to creating a more pragmatic and flexible pathway to align decarbonisation with competitiveness and resilience objectives.\"\n\n\"Today's proposals rightly recognise the need for more flexibility and technology neutrality to make the green transition a success,\" said Sigrid de Vries, ACEA director general. 'This constitutes a major change compared to the current law.\"\n\nHowever, de Vries did express some caution, saying that \"the devil can be very much in the detail\" and noting that the group would \"study the package, and work with co-legislators to critically strengthen the proposals where needed\".\n\nTo incentivise EV adoption and manufacturing in Europe, the EU will offer \"super credits\" for small affordable electric cars made in the EU.\n\nAcknowledging that EV uptake in the vans segment has been structurally more difficult, the European Commission announced that it would reduce the 2030 CO target for vans from 50% to 40%. It also proposed a \"targeted amendment\" to the CO emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles, with a flexibility easing the compliance with the 2030 targets.\n\nFor corporate vehicles, it noted that member states must set mandatory targets to support the zero- and low-emission vehicle uptake by large companies.",

      "title": "EU rollback of 2035 car emissions ban sparks climate concerns",
      "body": "The EU has softened its 2035 car emissions ban, raising questions about climate targets and the pace of EV adoption.\n\nEuropean officials on Tuesday moved to ease their ban on sales of cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, responding to pressure from governments and automakers.\n\nCurrently, EU law mandates that all new cars after 2035 need to have zero CO2 emissions. But, after industry pressure from some member states and the automotive industry, this target has now been watered down.\n\nThe Commission has eased the ban, saying that from 2035 onwards, carmakers will need to comply with a 90 per cent tailpipe emissions target instead of 100 per cent.\n\nEuropean Commission vice-president St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 called the plan a \"lifeline\" for Europe's automotive industry while insisting the bloc's climate objectives were still intact.\n\nWhile some EU member states, like Italy and Germany, pushed for the ban to be reversed, others have slammed the increased \"flexibility\" for combustion engine cars.\n\nFrench environment minister Monique Barbut said that France will do \"all we can\" to stop the proposal from becoming law when it is put to EU member states for approval.\n\nCritics add that the reversal sends confusing signals for both climate targets and manufacturers.\n\nThe transport sector is the only sector where greenhouse gas emissions have increased in the EU in the last three decades. Cars make up just over 60 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions from transport, according to European Environment Agency figures.\n\nEU officials say changing the limit will not affect progress toward making the 27-country bloc's economy climate neutral by 2050. Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told Euronews it was a \"smart, wise compromise for climate and competitiveness\".\n\nBut it does mean manufacturers will still be able to sell a limited number of polluting vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles with small combustion engines to extend their range and petrol and diesel cars, past 2035.\n\nTo do so, they will have to compensate for the remaining 10 per cent of emissions from these kinds of cars using two avenues. The first is by using low-carbon steel made in the EU. The second is out of their control and will come with the use of e-fuels or biofuels.\n\nS\u00e9journ\u00e9 told reporters in Strasbourg this week that \"all potential further emissions generated have to be fully offset upstream\".\n\nFully electric and hydrogen vehicles will also be encouraged, with manufacturers eligible for \"super credits\" if they produce them.\n\nSmall, compact and affordable electric vehicles made in the EU before 2035 could count as 1.3 vehicles, for example, making it easier for companies to reach emissions target quotas without incurring fines.\n\n'Complexity over clarity': Clean transport experts slam move as confusing\n\nCritics say that, instead of a \"lifeline\", the rollback is confusing for an automotive industry already preparing for the zero emissions target.\n\n\"The EU has chosen complexity over clarity. Breeding faster horses could never have halted the ascent of the automobile,\" says William Todts, executive director of clean transport think tank Transport & Environment (T&E).\n\n\"Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs while China races further ahead. Clinging to combustion engines won't make European automakers great again.\"\n\nT&E estimates that up to 25 per cent fewer battery electric vehicles would be sold in 2035 than would have been under the current target. It adds that credits for advanced biofuels and e-fuels would also allow carmakers to sell fewer EVs in return for non-existent emissions savings.\n\nAnd, in the case of advanced biofuels, which it says can't be scaled sustainably, it would also increase Europe's reliance on imports of used cooking oil and animal fats that are often subject to fraud.\n\nChris Heron, secretary general of trade association E-Mobility Europe, adds that \"hesitation is not a strategy\".\n\n\"Changing the rules midway through the game undermines business confidence after companies have already committed capital and built factories around a 100 per cent trajectory.\"\n\nAt the end of August, the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) and the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) wrote to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to say that a 100 per cent emissions reduction target for cars by 2035 was no longer feasible.\n\nThe letter argued that while its signatories were committed to achieving the EU's net zero by 2050 goal, manufacturers in the bloc are still almost totally dependent on Asia for batteries and face issues with US tariffs, higher manufacturing costs and a varied charging infrastructure.\n\n\"Meeting the rigid car and van CO2 targets for 2030 and 2035 is, in today's world, simply no longer feasible,\" they wrote, adding that legal mandates and penalties would not drive the transition.\n\nOn the other side of the debate, more than 150 bosses from Europe's electric car industry signed an open letter earlier this month urging the EU to stick to the 2035 emissions target. Referring to lobbying by the wider automotive industry, the letter said they were \"deeply concerned about recent efforts to dilute your objectives\".\n\nWith signatories from Volvo Cars and Polestar, it emphasises that any delays to the target would mean stalling Europe's EV market, handing an advantage to competitors elsewhere in the world and eroding the confidence of the market's investors.\n\nAllowing the extension of transitional technologies like plug-in hybrids or CO2-neutral fuels, the letter adds, creates uncertainty and slows the shift to electric vehicles as Chinese EV manufacturers push ahead.\n\n\"Every delay in Europe only widens the gap with China,\" the letter reads.\n\nBoth the EU and the US are moving more slowly in adopting electric cars than China, where battery vehicles were 34 per cent of the market in the third quarter. The growth of battery cars in China has been fuelled by state assistance and ferocious competition among Chinese automakers producing affordable vehicles.\n\nTristan Beucler, industry analyst from think tank Strategic Perspectives, says that electrification will happen, \"with or without the EU\".\n\n\"By choosing to scrap a clear industrial target, the Commission is weakening the business case for those companies that have made the necessary investments to electrify, and prolonging the life of a technology that has no path to competitiveness in the next decade,\" Beucler adds.\n\nSales of battery-only cars in Europe rose 26 per cent for the first 10 months of this year compared to the same period last year. Electric-only cars rose to 16 per cent of new car sales.\n\nYet petrol and diesel cars, though declining, remain significant. With the new 90 per cent emissions target, the EU expects that non-electric cars will make up around 30 to 35 per cent of sales by 2035.",

      "title": "EU walks back 2035 all-electric target, permitting some new combustion engine cars",
      "body": "A last-minute deal in Berlin ensured the death of the combustion engine ban -- a previously unthinkable outcome. Jordyn Dahl writes on the Politico website about the Commission's latest plan that now goes to the European Parliament and Council.\n\nAlso, check out the latest article by Monica Frassoni. She argues why the electric transition is an industrial necessity for Europe -- and what we should do now to still get it right. Monica works with business and civil society for a green, just transition and cooperate to projects on fair elections around the globe. She is a former MEP and Green leader and is President of European Alliance to Save Energy.\n\nIt was the crown jewel of a climate agenda that defined Ursula von der Leyen's first term as Commission president.\n\nBut a little over two years after it was enacted, the European Union's 2035 ban on gasoline-powered cars is dead.\n\nIts killers: Germany, home of Europe's largest car industry, and the center-right European People's Party, the pro-business political family to which von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz belong.\n\nIt was their pressure that forced the Commission's hand, after Berlin went from potentially abstaining on a vote to undercutting the entire combustion engine ban -- all within three weeks.\n\nUnder the new proposal, the ban would be replaced by a target to reduce emissions by 90 percent in all cars sold after 2035. That means a range of vehicles will be part of the mix long past 2035, including pure combustion engines and plug-in hybrids that have both a combustion engine and an electric motor -- as long as they are offset with made-in-EU green steel and alternative fuels derived from non-fossil sources.\n\nGermany and the EPP argued the outright ban constrained the ability of European automakers to compete and took the freedom of choice away from consumers.\n\n\"Six months ago, it was unthinkable that the Commission would make this course correction,\" an EU diplomat said, calling Germany's \"decisive intervention\" a game changer in the fate of the law. \"The ideology of pure electric is ending.\"\n\nAfter winning the majority of seats in the European Parliament in 2024, EPP chief Manfred Weber, also from Germany, said overturning the ban would be his top priority in the new era.\n\nWeber claimed victory on Tuesday, calling the reformed legislation cutting the 2035 emissions target from 100 percent to 90 percent a \"massive reduction.\"\n\n\"We only can win the fight against climate change if we combine it with an economically reasonable approach. The combustion engine is allowed to be sold in the European Union after 2035,\" he told a Tuesday press conference ahead of the announcement.\n\nCars account for 16 percent of EU emissions, making the ban an important -- and certainly the most visible -- pillar of the EU's climate policy of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.\n\nBy the Commission's own calculations, dropping the emissions target to 90 percent means that 25 percent of the cars sold after 2035 would emit CO2, equivalent to roughly 2.6 million vehicles.\n\nThe new targets are part of a broader automotive package put forward by the European Commission on Tuesday that included a new regulation mandating zero-emissions corporate fleet targets for each EU country, a battery booster to increase supply, and a regulatory red-tape cutting measure that introduces a new small-car initiative.\n\nThe combined measures are meant to boost Europe's automakers, which are facing a trade war courtesy of U.S. President Donald Trump, stiff competition from Chinese incumbents with high-tech electric vehicles, and stagnant sales across the bloc.\n\nGerman Chancellor Merz, who also advocated reversing the ban in his bid for office, took a more measured tone, calling the revised ban \"a clear signal\" that it is the right way to \"better align climate targets, market realities, companies and jobs.\"\n\nFor months Merz had tried to corral his governing coalition -- which combines the conservative Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats -- into a common position on the ban. While the CDU pushed hard for it to be overturned, the SPD wanted to hold the line.\n\nUltimately the conservatives won, putting forward a request for regulation that walks a line between industrial competitiveness and protecting the climate.\n\nWhile the Commission calls it a balanced approach that still paves the way for electric vehicles to take over from CO2-emitting cars, political groups across the spectrum call it a disaster -- albeit for different reasons.\n\nThe left says reversing the ban will deal a blow to the climate and yet fail to give Europe's automakers a competitive boost.\n\n\"The real problem facing Europe's car industry is not a law that takes effect in 10 years. It is the collapse of European car sales in China and the steady global decline of combustion-engine markets,\" said German Greens MEP Michael Bloss. \"Continuing to bet on combustion engines is not an industrial strategy -- it is a failure of one.\"\n\nFor the far right, meanwhile, the measures don't go far enough. MEP Volker Schnurrbusch, a member of Germany's opposition AfD party, said in a debate in the Parliament that the real issue is the Commission \"dictating\" what form of transport consumers use.\n\nThe European Conservatives and Reformists, meanwhile, called the reformed 2035 law a missed opportunity that \"falls short of providing the bold actions\" needed to make the sector more globally competitive.\n\nThe differing views on the ban's reversal will continue to be heard in negotiations among the EU's institutions, particularly in the Council where EU capitals will battle it out with Cyprus -- a small country with no automotive sector -- acting as referee.\n\nAlready, France is gearing up for a fight.\n\n\"The negotiations are just beginning,\" a Paris officials said, adding that allowing combustion engine cars to be sold past 2035 is a red line for the country, even as it gets its desired European preference requirements.\n\nBehind the scenes, the automotive sector will continue to lobby to undercut the regulation even more.\n\n\"The announced measures to mandate the greening of corporate fleets risk running counter to the necessary market and incentive-based approach,\" EU car lobby ACEA said in a statement.\n\nYet that is exactly what the Commission is hoping, with multiple industry officials telling POLITICO that the corporate fleets measure is meant to act as a backstop for the gutting of the combustion engine ban.\n\nClimate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra admitted as much in his remarks before the Parliament Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Corporate fleets will steer the clean transition and will help the automakers meet their targets,\" he said.\n\nThe proposal must now be debated by member countries and in the European Parliament.",

      "body": "BRUSSELS - The European Union announced a landmark 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars on Tuesday, as part of a package of reforms aimed at supporting Europe's embattled auto industry.\n\nThe ban was hailed as a major win in the fight against climate change when it was adopted in 2023, but carmakers and their backers have lobbied hard over the past year for Brussels to relax it, in the face of fierce competition from China and a slower-than-expected shift to electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nThe European Commission is expected to propose replacing the ban with a less ambitious 90% emissions-reduction target, a move critics say risks undermining the EU's green agenda and deterring investments in electrification.\n\nBut talks within the commission were going down to the wire ahead of an official announcement on Tuesday afternoon on what vehicles would be allowed to be sold after the deadline, according to EU sources.\n\n\"This is a critical milestone for the future of the sector. There is a lot at stake,\" Sigrid de Vries, the head of European auto lobby ACEA, told a press conference in Brussels on Monday, referring to the expected reforms. The ban was a cornerstone of the EU's environmental Green Deal, which has come under increased pressure from businesses and right-wing politicians as Europe seeks to bolster its industry.\n\n\"There is a clear demand for more flexibility on the CO2 targets,\" commission spokeswoman Paula Pinho told a press conference on Friday, saying Brussels was \"aiming for balance.\"\n\nCarmakers argue that the 2035 goal to have only electric vehicles sold in Europe, and an intermediate 2030 target, are no longer realistic.\n\nHigh upfront costs and the lack of adequate charging infrastructure in parts of the 27-nation bloc have meant consumers have been slow to adopt EVs.\n\nJust over 16% of new vehicles sold in the first nine months of 2025 are battery-powered, according to ACEA.\n\nAutomakers would like to see continued sales authorised for plug-in hybrids or those equipped with range extenders, small combustion engines that recharge the battery instead of powering the wheels.\n\nGermany and some eastern European nations support this, despite questions about the vehicles' green credentials; a recent report indicates that plug-in hybrids emit almost as much as petrol cars.\n\nPoisoning the debate\n\nOthers, such as Italy, want to see the use of alternative fuels, including those derived from agricultural crops and waste products, allowed.\n\nThat was a sticking point in talks on Tuesday morning, a commission source told AFP. Environmental groups oppose a massive adoption of biofuels, saying it would likely increase pesticide use, soil degradation, and deforestation.\n\nManfred Weber, the conservative head of the EU parliament's largest group, welcomed the new 90% emissions-reduction target, but said no engine should be banned, leaving the choice with consumers.\n\n\"Forbidding technologies\" was a gift to far-right populists, he told a press conference.\n\nThe expected lowering of ambitions is set to displease the Nordic countries, Spain, and, to an extent, France, which have long called for maintaining the planned trajectory to avoid harming firms that have invested in the transition to electric vehicles.\n\nBut William Todts, director of the clean-transport advocacy group T&E, said he hoped obtaining concessions would help the auto industry move on and stay the course towards a green transition.\n\n\"I hope that if they get a little bit of what they want, they will stop poisoning the political debate,\" he told AFP, arguing heated discussions had created confusion in the sector and among consumers.\n\nThe commission is also expected to unveil additional measures to support the sector, including plans for \"greening\" company fleets and encouraging production of small and \"affordable\" EVs.\n\nFrance has advocated a \"European preference\" requiring manufacturers receiving public subsidies to source components from within the bloc.\n\nRoad transport accounts for about 20% of total planet-warming emissions in Europe, and 61% of those come from cars' exhaust pipes, according to the EU.",

      "title": "EU Discarding Its Combustion Engine Car Ban Can Benefit Chinese Automakers, Insiders Say",
      "body": "(Yicai) Dec. 18 -- The fact that the European Union plans to backtrack on its plan to halt sales of new gasoline and diesel autos by 2035 could benefit Chinese carmakers, according to industry insiders.\n\nChinese pure electric vehicle manufacturers may hold an advantageous position in the new point-based system the EU plans to implement to replace the combustion engine car ban because they can generate additional income by selling excess credits, insiders explained. In contrast, European automakers may need to purchase credits to compensate for shortfalls in meeting emission standards.\n\nOn Dec. 16, the European Commission proposed to lift the sales ban on new gasoline and diesel cars from 2035 and replace it with a new regulation requiring automakers to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new vehicles by 90 percent compared with 2021 standards.\n\nMoreover, the regulation introduces a point-based reward mechanism. For each M1E class small EV that a manufacturer sells after completing the assembly of the vehicle and battery pack within the EU, it will receive 1.3 times the basic carbon emission points. These points can be directly used to offset the emission accounting for high-emission vehicle models.\n\nThe proposal, which still needs to be submitted for review to the European Parliament and the governments of member states, received strong support from German and Italian automakers. They believe that EVs in Europe face challenges, such as high prices and insufficient charging infrastructure, which makes the previous target unlikely to be reached.\n\nOther carmakers, such as Volvo Cars and its EV brand Polestar, have publicly defended the ban on combustion engine vehicles because they have invested much in the electrification and believe this could lead to the EU lagging behind others in the transition.\n\nOver 1.47 million EVs were registered in the EU in the first 10 months of this year, seizing a market share of 16.4 percent, compared with 13.2 percent a year earlier, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.\n\nSales of Chinese EVs in Europe are steadily increasing. Yicai learned from BYD that the Chinese new energy vehicle giant's sales in Spain and Germany surged 452 percent and 648 percent to 22,400 units and 19,200 units, respectively, in the first 11 months of this year from a year earlier. In Italy, its sales skyrocketed 4,800 percent to 20,200 units in the period, achieving a market share of 2.8 percent.\n\nBYD plans to continue accelerating its expansion in the European market and is expected to have 1,000 stores across 32 countries in Europe by the end of this year.\n\nSAIC Motor sold 173,900 units in the EU in the first 10 months of the year, up nearly 40 percent from the same period last year. Other Chinese carmakers, such as Changan Automobile, GAC Group, Nio, and Xpeng Motors, have also entered the European market.",

They make up a tiny portion of overall sales in southern and eastern Europe.\n\nCARMAKERS POURED BILLIONS INTO DESIGNING EVS\n\nThe change in policy is a blow for automakers and suppliers that have spent tens of billions of euros designing electric cars and expanding factory capacity based on EU policy that only became law in 2023.\n\nBut allowing traditional automakers to use different technologies may spur them to partner on developing affordable EVs, such as the tie-up between Ford and Renault made public last week to develop small EVs in Europe.\n\nThe day before the EU announcement, the U.S. automaker made public a $19.5 billion writedown and plans to scrap several electric models.\n\n\"This will end up driving more cooperation and platform-sharing,\" between automakers, said Joe Stevenson, CEO of British startup Anaphite, which \u2060is developing dry coating for battery electrodes that could cut the cost of an EV.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's news, Ford CEO Jim Farley urged Brussels to pick one policy and stick to it, rather than shifting every few months. As recently as March, the Commission gave the car industry \"breathing space\" by allowing automakers to comply with 2025 emissions targets over three years, with further changes nine months later.\n\n\"That's not the way to do long-term capital investment planning,\" Farley said. \"We need certainty.\"\n\n(Reporting by Nick Carey;Editing by Josephine Mason and Barbara Lewis)",

      "title": "EU's U-turn on combustion engines ban: complexity over clarity",
      "body": "Mauro swapped Sardinia for Eindhoven and has been an IO+ editor for 3 years. As a GREEN+ expert, he covers the energy transition with data-driven stories.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission reversed the existing phase-out of internal combustion engine (ICE) sales for 2035. The proposal, part of the Automotive Package, introduces new exemptions for plug-in and hybrid vehicles. Opponents view this plan as a move that would create market confusion and significantly slow down electrification.\n\nThe proposal weakens the previously set targets. By 2035, carmakers will need to meet a 90% reduction in tailpipe emissions. The remaining 10% of emissions will need to be offset by using EU-made green steel (up to 7%) and renewable fuels (the remaining 3%). This means it will still be possible to sell plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal-combustion-engine vehicles beyond 2035.\n\nThe watered-down targets come in a year where European and global electric vehicle (EV) sales are breaking records. In particular, EV sales in Europe surpassed 3.8 million in November -- 33% higher than the first 11 months of 2024.\n\nCasting uncertainty\n\nWilliam Todts, executive director at leading mobility non-governmental organization Transport & Environment (T&E), said: \"The EU has chosen complexity over clarity. Breeding faster horses could never have halted the ascent of the automobile. Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs, while China races further ahead. Clinging to combustion engines won't make European automakers great again.\"\n\nAutomakers now have greater flexibility to choose which strategies to pursue and which powertrains to bring to market. \"Yet, these strategies matter a lot for stakeholders such as consumers and grid operators, creating further instability,\" Todts added.\n\nChris Heron, Secretary General of E-Mobility Europe, a trade association uniting the European e-mobility ecosystem, commented on the proposal. \"It's the wrong time for Europe to take the wind out of its own sails. Europe's electric car markets are growing strongly in 2025, yet by reopening the door to plug-ins, hybrids, and unscalable biofuels, we risk slowing ourselves down in a highly competitive global race. The future of transport is electric; Europe needs to recommit to building it as we move forward. \"\n\nLast week, the trade association sent the Commission a letter -- alongside 200 signatories, including carmakers Volvo and Polestar -- to maintain the 100% zero-emission target.\n\nSignificant BEV slowdown\n\nAccording to a T&E analysis, the Commission's proposal could cut the market share of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) by a quarter by 2035. The same study also underscores the uncertainty the Package creates, as the 90% target could lead to different powertrain mixes depending on the strategies automakers adopt.\n\n\u00a9 T&E\n\nIn addition to the green steel and renewable fuels compensations, the Package also introduces \"super credits\" for small, affordable EVs made in the EU. This measure targets so-called e-cars under 4.2 meters long.\n\nThis plan presents a 1.3 multiplier, meaning that every tiny electric car sold counts as 1.3 zero-emission cars toward a carmaker's CO target, reducing the number of EVs they would need to sell overall. Additionally, carmakers, during the period between 2025 and 2027, are allowed to average their emissions on the path to 2030.\n\nThe struggle to compete with China\n\nWith the Chinese car manufacturer BYD now the world's leading EV brand, China has the upper hand, as other manufacturers, such as NIO and Xiaomi, can target the market with lower-priced cars. The Commission claims the Package -- which results from the strategic dialogue it started with all industry stakeholders -- will make the European car industry more competitive.\n\nSince October last year, the Commission has imposed import duties on Chinese EVs. The tariffs can be up to 35.3% of the car price, in addition to the existing 10% import tariff. In the first half of 2025, no Chinese BEV showed up in the top 10 of the most sold EVs in Europe.\n\nEarlier this year, EU officials also watered down this year's emission compliance targets, allowing carmakers to meet them by 2027. The Automotive Package is yet another concession to car manufacturers, particularly German and Italian ones, who pushed to reverse the ban.\n\nStrengthening the battery value chain\n\nUnder the Automotive Package umbrella is also the Battery Booster. The initiative -- backed by \u20ac1.8 billion in financing -- aims to develop a domestic battery value chain. The largest share of this amount (\u20ac1.5 billion) is allocated to European battery cell producers, who will be eligible for interest-free loans.\n\nThe Commission also announced that further measures will be implemented to strengthen the sector's cost competitiveness and secure the materials supply chain. The battery is the single most expensive component of an EV. Chinese producers such as CATL dominate the market, selling the majority of the batteries that are in the market today.\n\nThe future remains electric\n\nAccording to T&E, a positive aspect of the Automotive Package is the introduction of national electrification targets for large company fleets. Yet the NGO points out that these are not ambitious enough to drive uptake in a sector that accounted for 58% of new registrations in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nDespite the uncertainty the plan casts, both T&E and E-Mobility Europe are confident the future will be electric. \"Once the dust has settled, we're confident the core of the 2035 framework will still matter more for the market than today's exemptions. The world's transition to electric vehicles is irreversible, shaped by cost and efficiency,\" stated Heron.",

      "title": "Carmakers sour on EU's 'disastrous' petrol engine rule changes",
      "body": "The car industry has soured on the EU's plan to ease the 2035 ban on combustion engines as details have become clearer, with some executives warning the \"disastrous\" changes would lead to more expensive vehicles.\n\nBrussels said on Tuesday it would scrap a law forcing carmakers to cut their emissions to zero by 2035. While carmakers will be allowed to carry on releasing 10 per cent of their 2021 emissions and to continue selling some petrol engines and hybrids, the European Commission has mandated that the emissions be offset by using low-carbon steel and sustainable fuels.\n\nThe softening of the 2035 ban was meant to be a hard-won victory for carmakers after months of intense lobbying. Although it was initially welcomed by some carmakers, many companies said the offsets would be too challenging to bring in since the required use of green steel and \"made in Europe\" content in vehicles would be complex and expensive.\n\n\"In times when European economic strength is crucial, this entire package from Brussels is disastrous,\" said Hildegard M\u00fcller, president of the German car lobby VDA. \"What appears to be greater openness is fraught with so many obstacles that it risks remaining ineffective in practice.\"\n\nStellantis, the European group behind the Jeep, Fiat and Peugeot brands, said the proposals failed to address the challenges in the electric transition for light commercial vehicles and did not include enough flexibility to meet emissions targets in 2030.\n\n\"The introduction of technology neutrality through the revision of the 2035 CO\u2082 reduction target is an important step but, as currently proposed, it will not support the production of affordable vehicles for the vast majority of customers,\" it said.\n\nAuto industry analyst Matthias Schmidt predicted petrol cars would \"become haute couture Swiss watches of the motor industry\" with the added costs of green steel and renewable fuel priced in.\n\nThe French car industry body, the Plateforme automobile (PFA), has adopted a more measured approach to the package, saying that the policies \"represent an initial response to the urgent challenges facing the European automotive industry today\".\n\nFrance, which had pushed for \"made in Europe\" protections that are set to be announced in January, was broadly reassured by the measures, one industry expert said, although the PFA wants to see more flexibility for vans and on 2030 emissions targets.\n\nIn a sign of deep division among EU member states, negotiations over the revision, particularly on whether full combustion engines should still be allowed after 2035 and on national targets to electrify corporate fleets, ran down to the wire on Tuesday.\n\nA senior EU official said the offsets for the final 10 per cent were a \"pretty strong compromise\" given heated politics around the easing of the ban, which has been heavily lobbied by industry and countries such as Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic.\n\nManfred Weber, the Bavarian leader of the conservative European People's party, the European parliament's largest political group, had claimed victory on Friday, saying the Commission would put forward \"a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines\", without mentioning conditions for green steel and renewable fuel.\n\nChris Heron, secretary-general of E-Mobility Europe, a trade association, estimated that the changes meant that plug-in hybrids and other petrol vehicles could account for more than a quarter of new car sales in Europe based on preliminary estimates.\n\n\"By reopening the door to plug-ins, hybrids and unscalable biofuels, we risk slowing ourselves down in a highly competitive global race,\" Heron said.\n\nThe proposal setting binding national EV ratios for zero emissions corporate vehicles was among the most contested elements, EU officials said. A draft list of targets showed that Germany was originally expected to run an entirely electric corporate fleet after 2035 but after negotiations on Tuesday, the goal was reduced to 95 per cent.\n\nEU officials said the corporate fleets proposal was critical to maintaining the bloc's ambitions for cutting emissions in the road transport sector, which accounts for about 20 per cent of the total, because it would expand the second-hand market for electric cars.\n\n\"A great aspect is that it brings these vehicles to the second-hand market much faster,\" one official noted, adding that about 80 per cent of EU citizens buy cars second-hand.\n\nBut Richard Knubben, director-general at Leaseurope, which represents Europe's leasing and automotive rental companies, warned that limiting financing options for companies and the lack of incentives for EV uptake meant that the corporate fleets rules were \"likely to make a difficult situation worse for the manufacturers\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Ian Johnston in Paris",

      "title": "EU eases petrol and diesel car ban amid pressure from Chinese EVs",
      "body": "Europe to relax its ban on conventional cars following pressured industry and EV competition.\n\nJAKARTA - The European Union plans to loosen its policy banning the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles from 2035, following strong pressure from the region's automotive industry.\n\nThe move, announced by the European Commission on Tuesday, is seen as the EU's biggest retreat from its green agenda in recent years.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the policy change still requires approval from member state governments and the European Parliament.\n\nCar manufacturers in Germany and Italy have been among the most vocal in pushing for a relaxation of the rules, as they face intense competition from Tesla and Chinese electric vehicle makers.\n\nThe European Commission has proposed revising the emissions target from a requirement of full zero emissions by 2035 to a 90% reduction in CO\u2082 emissions compared with 2021 levels. Automakers would also be allowed to offset remaining emissions through the use of low-carbon steel, synthetic fuels and non-food biofuels.\n\n\"Opening the market to combustion-engine vehicles while compensating for emissions is a pragmatic step and in line with market conditions,\" said Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker.\n\nHowever, the policy easing has drawn criticism from environmental groups. Dominic Phinn of the Climate Group described the move as a \"tragic victory\" for the conventional automotive industry.\n\n\"Rolling back the phase-out of petrol and diesel engines runs counter to leading European companies that have invested billions of dollars in electric fleets and depend heavily on the certainty this provides,\" he said.\n\nThe European Commission is also granting carmakers additional transition time to meet emissions-reduction targets.\n\nThe policy shift comes amid weakening global demand for electric vehicles, including in the United States, marked by Ford's decision to halt production of certain EV models.\n\nEven so, analysts say the EU's policy direction is becoming more flexible. \"The reality is more complex; we are likely to see a shift away from absolute and blanket bans towards a more flexible compliance system, marking a turning point in Europe's transition story,\" Jefferies wrote.\n\nEuropean carmakers, including Volkswagen and Stellantis, have warned of soft EV demand and rising pressure from Chinese manufacturers, both domestically and globally.\n\nFrom the EV industry's perspective, the easing of emissions targets risks undermining investment and Europe's competitiveness.\n\n\"A shift from a clear 100% zero-emissions target to 90% may seem small, but if we step back now, we will not only damage the climate, we will also damage Europe's ability to compete,\" said Polestar chief executive Michael Lohscheller.\n\nThe European Commission insisted it would continue to promote electric vehicle adoption, including by expanding EV use in corporate fleets and creating a new regulatory category for small, domestically produced EVs, alongside additional incentives to support the transition of Europe's automotive industry.

The remaining 10% of emissions will however be required to compensated for, through the use of low-carbon steel produced in the European Union, or through the use of e-fuels and biofuels.\n\n\"This will allow for plug-in hybrids (PHEV), range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal combustion engine vehicles to still play a role beyond 2035, in addition to full electric (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles,\" the European Commission said in a statement. Notably, the EC did not state an end date for the sale of ICE-powered vehicles.\n\nAhead of 2035, manufacturers will be given \"super credits\" towards emissions targets for small EVs produced in the European Union to encourage the production of small EVs, while additional flexibility is granted to the vans segment with a CO2 reduction target that is reduced from 50% to 40%.\n\nThe European Commission also proposed a targeted amendment of CO2 standards for heavy-duty vehicles with \"a flexibility easing the compliance with the 2030 targets\".\n\n\"Innovation.

      "title": "Invest In Electric: Why Germany's Combustion Engine Win Risks EU Industrial Loss - Analysis",
      "body": "Germany, Italy and six other member states have convinced the European Union to soften its plan to ban the sale of cars with combustion engines by 2035. The rollback means that a car registered in 2036 will likely still be on the road in 2050, which is the EU's climate-neutrality target year.\n\nBrussels's weakening of the 2035 phase-out locks in emissions, prolongs dependence on imported fuels and diverts capital away from the technologies driving European competitiveness. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers are rapidly expanding their footprint in Europe; the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) market share is expected to double to around 15% in 2025.\n\nNow Berlin is doubling down on preserving internal combustion engines, even as German customer trends show where the future lies: battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations rose by nearly 50% in October 2025 year-on-year. This makes EVs one of the few growth segments in an otherwise stagnating market.\n\nAs China bets on batteries, scale and simplified architectures, Europe risks betting on nostalgia. But it instead needs to become a leader in technologies bought by global consumers.\n\nSolution\n\nShould the changes come into force (they first require approval by the College of Commissioners, and European Council and European Parliament ratification), the EU and its member states need compensating measures to raise EV ambition.\n\nEU policymakers should:\n\n* Lock in a hard EV ramp\u2011up despite a softer fleet target.The EU needs to set binding interim targets for EV shares in new registrations (for example, for 2030 and 2035), with support for companies that exceed them -- or penalties for companies that miss. Without this, a 90% fleet target could become an invitation to continue selling combustion cars well into the 2030s.\n\n* Use industrial policy to restructure, not preserve the status quo. The EU needs to direct support (tax breaks, state aid, depreciation rules) towards investment in EVs, batteries and charging infrastructure, rather than generic \"clean\" combustion engines. This public money should help accelerate the shift already underway in corporate and fleet markets.\n\n* Reframe the political narrative. With the ban likely diluted, the EU needs to communicate that this painful -- from a cultural and consumer standpoint -- transition is not a reason to cling to a shrinking market. Without strong domestic EV capabilities, Europeans will lose pricing power and become passive buyers in a Chinese\u2011dominated market.\n\nContext\n\nEuropean People's Party leader Manfred Weber has announced that the EU will not proceed with the planned full 2035 combustion ban. The European Commission has instead proposed shifting from a 100% CO2 reduction target for new car fleets to a 90% reduction -- under this new scheme, up to 10% of new car registrations could have combustion engines powered by synthetic e-fuels.\n\nThe change follows German chancellor Friedrich Merz's call for dual-drive systems and \"highly efficient\" engines post-2035, amid public opposition to the ban fuelled by job-loss fears. Germany's minister-president of Bavaria, Markus S\u00f6der, argues that even a 10% e-fuel carve-out \"is not enough\".\n\nBut markets have already moved on. BEV and plug-in hybrid vehicles are the clearest sources of growth in Germany's otherwise weak new-car market; China continues dominating EV exports despite tariffs. Europe risks ceding ground by clinging to an identity tied to combustion rather than competing in technologies that define the future.\n\nThe European Council on Foreign Relations does not take collective positions.

      "body": "The government has dismissed reports that it plans to move up the review of electric vehicle sales targets from 2027 to next year amid concerns from the automobile industry.\n\nThe government said it would weaken zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) obligations introduced in April to force car manufacturers to sell more electric cars each year or face steep fines after lobbying from the car industry, and planned to review its targets.\n\nThe review of ZEV mandates begins next year and of course we want to complete the review as quickly as possible, industry secretary Chris McDonald told the Financial Times.\n\nHowever, a government spokesman later said only preparatory work would begin next year and the review itself was due to be published in 2027.\n\nCar manufacturers have argued the rules are economically unsustainable, and Britain has introduced flexibility, which would allow them to earn credits by selling hybrid cars that combine smaller batteries and gasoline engines. The loophole allows automakers to sell more hybrids, which could make them more profitable amid fierce competition from rivals, including from China.\n\nReferring to the changes to the rules introduced in the spring, McDonald said: We have to be accountable to the industry and also responsive to where the market is.\n\nA government spokesperson said: We have not undertaken a review of the ZEV Order. As previously promised, we plan to publish the review in early 2027. This means that preparatory work will begin next year to ensure proper stakeholder involvement.\n\nZero-emission vehicles are better for your family's finances and better for the environment.

The transition to EVs is critical to delivering jobs and growth, improved air quality and energy security, as well as quieter, cleaner towns and cities.\n\nMcDonald was speaking during a visit to the Nissan plant in Sunderland, where the Japanese carmaker has started producing its latest electric vehicle.\n\nThe launch of the third-generation Leaf, the first mass-market battery electric car produced in the UK, is seen as a significant step in the UK car industry's move away from petrol and diesel.\n\nNissan has already produced more than 280,000 Leaf models at its northeast England plant, the UK's largest car factory.\n\nElectric vehicle sales have increased rapidly in recent years. They accounted for more than a fifth of the UK market in July.\n\nBut automakers previously overestimated demand for EVs and had to lower prices to attract buyers.\n\nMinisters said they would not weaken plans to ban the sale of new petrol or diesel cars from 2035 after the EU announced plans to delay the phase-out of new internal combustion engine cars.\n\nThe European Union (EU) said it would no longer require car manufacturers to ensure that 100% of cars and vans produced from 2035 have zero emissions.\n\nAfter strong pressure from the car industry and leaders of several EU member states, including Germany and Italy, the European Commission promised to lower this requirement to 90%. This would enable 10% of production after 2035 to be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles or pure combustion engine vehicles.\n\nIn a compromise with the industry, automakers must compensate with other green measures on the factory floor, such as using green steel from Europe or using biofuels in non-electric vehicles.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online",

      "title": "European Union Surrenders to Reality on 2035 Ban on Gas-Powered Cars",
      "body": "There have been many interesting changes to the climate recently... and the one I am referring to here is the political one.\n\nLess than 2 months ago, President Donald Trump declared victory over \"climate crisis\" hysteria as it has become apparent that a global, man-caused disaster is unlikely to occur, and the media has begun to signal defeat in their drive to push this narrative.\n\nBolivia and Chile have joined Argentina in electing business-oriented leadership uninterested in pursuing economy-crushing climate inanity.\n\nBulgaria was slated to join the Eurozone this January. Still, citizen protests have arisen, driven partly by resistance to rule by bureaucrats from afar, which have likely resulted in new leadership less likely to embrace those plans.\n\nClearly, the influence of both climate cultists and European politicos is waning.\n\nIn a critical sign of political climate change, and after years of mandating an end to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2035, combustion and hybrid cars will likely remain on sale in the European Union after 2035 under a proposed change that softens the bloc's original plan for a 100% phase\u2011out of ICE options.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission proposed applying the ban, approved in 2023, to only 90% of vehicles, down from 100%. This means the remaining 10% of new cars made after 2035 could still be plug-in hybrid vehicles or those with internal combustion engines.\n\nThe move, unveiled by the EU's executive arm alongside other measures to support the bloc's car industry, represents a setback for tackling climate change, although the commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe remains \"at the forefront of the global clean transition.\"\n\n\"From 2035 onwards, carmakers will need to comply with a 90% tailpipe emissions reduction target, while the remaining 10% emissions will need to be compensated through the use of low-carbon steel ... or from e-fuels and biofuels,\" the European Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe proposal is likely to be approved by European lawmakers. Prior to the announcement, Reuters reported that Manfred Weber, president of the EPP, the largest party in the European Parliament, said the EU was planning to scrap the ban and indicated that he supported the new plan.\n\nAllowing a mere 10% may not seem like much, but I expect that percentage to increase steadily. However, as with the elite media, the bureaucrats are likely slow-rolling their tacit admission that the climate crisis was built on pseudoscience. Furthermore, it is the beginning of an acknowledgement that the automobile manufacturers' warnings about the technical realities of this E.U. pipe dream were correct.\n\nAs a reminder, about one year ago, I wrote about BMW's CEO, Oliver Zipse, arguing that the 2035 ban on ICE cars was unrealistic and could increase reliance on Chinese batteries.\n\nAt the this month's Paris Auto Show, BMW's CEO, Oliver Zipse, made it clear that Europe needs a new regulatory approach, one that leverages its own strengths in technology and doesn't hinge so heavily on battery imports.\n\n\"A correction of the 100% BEV target for 2035 as part of a comprehensive CO2-reduction package would also afford European OEMs less reliance on China for batteries,\" Zipse said according to Auto News. \"To maintain the successful course, a strictly technology-agnostic path within the policy framework is essential.\"\n\nPerhaps, in addition to making cars that function in today's world and that people want to drive, it is a sign that Europeans are beginning to detach themselves from a heavy reliance on anything Chinese. That, too, would be a win for the nations on that continent.\n\nThe moves, which require approval from EU governments and the European Parliament, mark the bloc's biggest retreat from its green policies enacted over the previous five years.\n\nIt follows Ford Motor announcing on Monday a $US19.5 billion ($A29.4 billion) writedown as it axes several EV models, in response to US policies and weakening EV demand.\n\nEuropean car makers including Volkswagen and Fiat owner Stellantis have also flagged soft EV demand and urged looser targets and lower fines for missing them.\n\n...German manufacturers are under particular strain as they lose ground in China to local rivals and face growing competition at home from Chinese EV imports.\n\nAs she often does, Hot Air's Beege Welborn distills this development into a high-octane summary.\n\nIt's kind of interesting how - let mix my metaphors here now - the Brussels Brahmins split the baby to supposedly appease the industry, which catches serious grief here for their 'heavy lobbying,' while bowing to the brutal reality check of what the ban was going to do to the collective European economy. That is not emphasized as much.\n\nIn fact, it's not even discussed, as no one likes to admit, especially the Imperial EU hierarchy, that they've been running high on unicorn fart power instead of fact-based decisions for their regulation spewing.\n\nIn a nutshell, carmakers and E.U. member states argued that a full ban was too abrupt, risking jobs, competitiveness, and consumer backlash, and E.U. legislators appear to have listened. The result is a compromise in which electric vehicles remain the main destination, but combustion cars get to coast in the right lane for a while longer.\n\nMy 2026 prediction is that ICE cars will continue down European roads into the foreseeable future, because deadlines will get extended and percentages increased.\n\nDonations tax deductible\n\nto the full extent allowed by law.",

      "title": "Should I wait before buying an EV after major EU petrol car ruling",
      "body": "The EU has announced a significant rollback in its proposals to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, in a move that could have a big impact on the UK's own zero emissions mandate and electric vehicle market.\n\nOn Tuesday, the EU announced it would ease its proposed ban on sales of new cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, responding to pressure from governments and sections of motor industry.\n\nBusinesses in the sector had argued that they needed more flexibility in finding ways to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and help achieve EU climate goals. They had also pointed to low electric vehicle (EV) sales figures.\n\nThe EU's policy was already less ambitious than the UK's, which still plans to ban the sale of new cars without batteries by 2030.\n\nAs the EU's car market is heavily integrated with the UK's, some commentators have said the UK government may be forced to change its policy as well.\n\nWhat changes has the EU announced?\n\nProposals from the European Commission mean that EU targets would shift to a 90% cut in CO2 emissions from 2021 levels, instead of current rules that all new cars and vans from 2035 have zero emissions.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that most cars would be battery-only, but would leave room for some cars with internal combustion engines. The less stringent limit would leave room for automakers to continue selling some plug-in hybrids.\n\nEU officials have argued that changing the limit will not affect progress towards making the 27-country bloc's economy climate neutral by 2050. The proposals still require approval from EU governments and the European Parliament.\n\nHow could this affect the UK?\n\nThe UK has a similar policy called the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which aims for 100% of new car and van sales to be zero emission by 2035.\n\nThe sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned by 2030, although hybrids will still be able to be sold until 2035.\n\nThe UK has a much higher EV adoption rate (at 22%) than the EU's 16%, but this is still below the government-mandated target of 28% by the end of 2025.\n\nBloomberg estimates the UK has now overtaken Germany to become the largest electric car market in Europe.\n\nBut it has recently become an increasingly contentious political issue. Despite initially being a Conservative policy under Rishi Sunak's government, the zero-emission vehicle mandate is now unpopular in the party and Kemi Badenoch recently pledged to scrap the ZEV altogether.\n\nThe new EU policy has added further fuel to those who argue the current rules are too strict and make the UK an uncompetitive place to produce and sell cars.\n\nThe UK's largest car export market is to the EU, so any policy change there will impact manufacturers' opinions.\n\nThe former chief executive of Aston Martin, Andy Palmer, told The Times the UK would have to follow the EU's lead because of the high number of vehicles traded between the two areas.\n\n\"It becomes very difficult because if the EU drops their ban the factories there won't ramp up their EV (electric vehicle) production in the way forecast. There wouldn't be enough EVs to meet the demand required in the UK.\"\n\nBut there has also been a push back from the EV industry in the UK, with many arguing the government should not change its policy because of the clarity it gives to automakers.\n\nFiona Howarth, the director of Octopus Electric Vehicles, told Yahoo News: \"Weakening policy only undermines the investment needed to compete.\n\n\"The UK has a unique opportunity to hold firm, provide policy certainty and attract the talent and capital needed to secure its place as a leader in the electric transition for generations to come.\"\n\nShould you buy an EV car now or wait?\n\nSo far, the stance from the government is that the EU's decision should not impact UK customers.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"We remain committed to phasing out all new non-zero emission car and van sales by 2035.\"\n\nBut the Financial Times reported on 17 December that the government was considering reviewing some its targets in 2026 rather than 2027 in response to industry pressure, which could indicate the ZEV may be watered down.\n\nAny pledge by the Conservative Party would also be unlikely to come into effect by the next election in 2029 at the earliest, which is so close to the beginning of the 2030 deadline that it is unlikely the industry would change any of its planning.\n\nEdmund King, the president of the AA, told Yahoo News that weakening long-term targets was the wrong way to go about things.\n\nHe said: \"Consumers and industry need certainty and long-term targets and incentives to help transform to a zero-emission future... any further diluting of targets is likely to backfire.\"\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that EVs will become a bad purchase in the next few years, with the auto industry often operating on 10-year planning cycles, meaning any dramatic shift away from supporting them is unlikely.\n\nEven a weakened ZEV mandate or a shift in the market from the EU would only slow down their eventual adoption, it is unlikely to ever be reversed.\n\nThe UK is also offering a range of discounts on the most efficient EVs, knocking almost \u00a34,000 off the ticket price of several cars.\n\nChinese EV makers are also growing in popularity in the UK, with their cars often coming in cheaper than their competitors - making purchasing one more competitive than ever.\n\nHowever, consumers should also consider that the UK is planning on introducing a new 3p per mile tax for electric cars in 2028 as it seeks to recoup losses from shrinking fuel duty receipts.\n\nVicky Parrot, editor for Electrifying.com, told Yahoo News the government feels like it is \"simply giving with one hand and taking away with the other\" when it comes to encouraging the adoption of EVs.\n\nShe said: \"It's confusing for buyers and for the industry, and it's very damaging to the transition to EVs and to Britain's wider automotive industry.\"\n\nBut even with the new tax analysis by the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit estimated the changes would mean electric vehicles would still be roughly \u00a31,000 cheaper per year to run than their petrol counterparts.",

      "body": "The UK government has doubled down on its pledge to ban the sale of pure petrol and diesel cars by 2030 and all non-zero emission models by 2035. This comes after the EU itself sent seismic waves through the car industry with its landmark decision to repeal the 2035 ban.\n\nIn a statement dated 16 December 2025, Wopke Hoekstra, European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, said:\n\nAdvertisement - Article continues below.\n\nToday we are stepping up to ensure a successful, clean future for the automotive sector. We are introducing flexibility to manufacturers, which should be compensated for by the use of low-carbon steel and sustainable fuels, thereby reducing emissions.\n\nScraping petrol and diesel ban plan: what does it mean in practice?\n\nSo what does this mean? The previous plan allowed only pure electric and hydrogen cars to be sold in the EU after 2035, but the new amendments will allow manufacturers to consider selling plug-in, full and mild hybrid models as well as older internal combustion petrol and diesel models after this date.\n\nThe problem is that these types of vehicles may only account for 10% of sales. Manufacturers must offset the emissions produced by these vehicles by using low-carbon steel during manufacturing or by powering the vehicles with e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nAdditionally, by 2035, manufacturers will be able to take advantage of super credits for so-called small electric vehicles. At less than 4.3 meters in length, these models each count as 1.3 vehicles towards their manufacturing quota, allowing manufacturers to effectively make progress towards their emissions targets.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online",

      "body": "Decarbonising the transport sector remains vital to cut emissions\n\nThe announcement by the European Commission on Tuesday that it had dropped a complete ban on combustion engines by 2035 was not a surprise in view of developments over recent months, but nevertheless it still looks like a step in the wrong direction.\n\nThe European automotive industry as well as countries such as Germany and Italy had mounted a sustained lobbying effort over the past few months to force the Commission to dilute the 2035 combustion engine ban.\n\nThe argument for a compromise on the targets may appear compelling from an economic and competitiveness perspective. The European car industry is under pressure from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and the importation of cheap electric vehicles from China.\n\nInstead of a 100 per cent ban on combustion engines by 2035, this has been reduced to 90 per cent and car manufacturers have been given a longer lead-in time to comply with 2030 CO2 reduction targets. Some offsetting measures were also announced, such as the greater use of green steel made in Europe in manufacturing and the use of bio-fuels in non-electric vehicles.\n\nThe EU had pledged to be a world leader in the adoption of climate change targets, but the latest announcement shows that its fragile economy is a more important short-term priority. However, economic pressures do not obviate the fact that climate change is an existential threat that will wreak significant damage in the short, medium and long term. Transport accounts for 30 per cent of EU CO2 emissions.\n\nThe Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland annual report published on Wednesday shows that while Ireland's CO2 emissions have decreased by 16 per cent since 2018, the State is still not on track to meet its legally mandated 2030 targets. Crucially, 93 per cent of Ireland's transport sector is still powered by fossil fuels. For both Ireland and the EU, the road to meaningful change in CO2 reductions is through decarbonising the transport sector. The European Commission is just delaying the inevitable.",

      "title": "EU CO2 Plan Gets Mixed Reception Ahead Of Parliamentary Scrutiny",
      "body": "Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\n\nThe European Commission's plans to dilute its original insistence on an electric vehicle monopoly in new car sales by 2035 hasn't pleased everybody, and was described as disappointing for automakers and ineffective by environmental groups.\n\nBut the proposals are nowhere near being finalized and there will be months of agonizing in the European Parliament before the final edition emerges.\n\nThe European Commission conceded automakers' top priority by ending the 2035 date for them to achieve zero carbon dioxide emissions in new cars sold, which had effectively mandated an EV monopoly. But instead of opting for a let-the-market-decide, technology-free-for-all, the Commission decided automakers should cut emissions by 90%, not 100%, compared with the base year 2021. This allows a limited number of pure internal combustion engines, as well as hybrids, plug-in hybrids, extended-range electric vehicles and hydrogen-based ICE. Other measures included incentives to build small, cheap EVs.\n\nThe Commission also allowed some tinkering with the 2030 stage of CO2 emissions, allowing them to be averaged out over two more years. There is a new corporate fleet CO2 target.\n\nReaction was varied.\n\nHildergard Mueller, president of the German auto industry's VDA, said the proposed measures were not only inadequate, they added more negatives with an insistence on the use of some environmentally friendly steel. Mueller said the Commission had failed in its mission to create flexibility.\n\n\"Brussels has disappointed with its draft proposal,\" Mueller said, according to Reuters.\n\nClinging to combustion engines\n\nBrussels-based green lobby group Transport & Environment reacted to the proposals with a statement headlined \"EU 2035 reversal: playing for time won't make European carmakers great again\".\n\n\"Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs while China races further ahead. Clinging to combustion engines won't make European automakers great again,\" said T&E executive director William Todts.\n\nInvestment bank UBS described the Commission's proposals as \"moderate adjustments\".\n\n\"Given some elevated expectations about a fundamental shift of EU CO2 policies for the auto sector, we think the announced package will be seen at best as \"in line\" or even as a moderate disappointment,\" UBS said in a report.\n\n\"The 2035 de facto ICE ban removal eliminates the tail risks of regulatory fines and therefore has a small positive impact..... especially relevant for the premium/luxury ICE car segment, but it's also clear that the EU still wants the vast majority of new car sales to be fully electric by the middle of next decade. (manufacturers) won't take this regulation amendment as a reason to change investment strategies,\" UBS said.\n\n\"The new small affordable car category could potentially be a moderate positive for Stellantis and Renault , who are most exposed to the small affordable EV segment, followed by VW, \" according to UBS.\n\nReuters Breakingviews column wasn't impressed.\n\n\"Europe's backsliding on electric vehicles is a measly Christmas stocking-filler for carmakers. Brussels on Tuesday abandoned plans to make battery rides account for 100% of sales by 2035. Still, the rules are tougher than American ones, meaning that Volkswagen and its European peers probably won't slash EV plans in the way Ford Motor did. Looser targets may, however, embolden governments to slam the brakes on the green-car transition,\" Breakingviews columnist Neil Unmack said.\n\nFord Motor announced Monday it was dropping its F-150 EV as a part of slashing its electric plans and pivoting back to hybrid and gasoline vehicles. Ford said it will take a $19.5 billion special charge in the current quarter.\n\nFelipe Munoz, industry expert who runs the industry research platform Car Industry Analysis, thought the Commission proposals were a step in the right direction.\n\n\"It was obvious that the European industry was never prepared to meet this ambitious/unrealistic goals for 2035. And the best example is their inability to produce real affordable EVs and how they keep losing ground to the really competitive Chinese rivals,\" Munoz said.\n\n\"The initial objective that was wisely modified yesterday, was basically asking the European companies to stop selling to 80%-85% of the customers that are still buying ICE/HEV/MHEV/PHEV. That is nonsense, especially when the local industry has not been able to secure the supply chain for the production of batteries.\" he said.\n\nMunoz said between January and September 2025 in Europe, Chinese car brand sales increased 91% compared to the same period of 2024. They sold 510,000 vehicles in Europe, 5.2% of the total market.\n\n\"Whether these are fully electric or not, the Chinese are increasing their presence because all of their products are more competitive,\" he said.\n\nSteve Young, managing director of British-based automotive retailing consultancy ICDP, wondered why the Commission wanted to incentivize European small cars.\n\n\"Given the well-known challenges of making a profit on small cars and the likelihood that customers will be able to buy cars from the next class up for only a modest additional monthly payment, it defeats me trying to think why this measure is seen to be helpful.\" Young said.\n\nYoung said rather than struggling to meet Chinese standards he advocates a more aggressive strategy.\n\n\"The only way we can beat a low-cost competitor is by changing the game, and that requires innovation, for example, through having different batteries or different powertrains altogether rather than trying to play catch-up. That was what the Chinese did with their New Energy Vehicle policy in 2012, leapfrogging the global manufacturers' lead in ICE engines and transmissions.\" Young said in an email exchange.\n\nThe fate of the Commission's proposals will be decided in the European Parliament. EPP (European People's Party), is the biggest political grouping, composed of national center-right parties such as Germany's Christian Democrats and Spain's Popular Party.\n\nThe EPP Group described the Commission's proposals as a more realistic, technology-neutral policy that takes climate protection and industrial competitiveness into account in equal measure. The previous approach was well-intentioned but misguided in key areas - technological openness was replaced by ideology and industrial reality by symbolic politics.\n\n\"The ban on combustion engines was a mistake that is now being corrected. The sector is facing profound structural changes and massive global competitive pressure. This is precisely why it needs technology-neutrality and reliable, long-term and internationally competitive framework conditions. The departure from the combustion engine ban is a decisive contribution to this,\" said Jens Gieseke MEP, EPP Group spokesman on the automotive industry.\n\n\"We need a realistic, low-bureaucracy approach that strengthens production sites in Europe while also taking sufficient account of the international supply chains of European manufacturers. We also reject mandatory national electric car quotas for fleet operators,\" said Gieseke.\n\n\"(the) proposal marks the starting point for a definitive change of course in EU climate and industry politics. The aim must be to effectively reduce CO2 emissions while securing jobs and industrial value creation in Europe. It is now important to ensure that the package presented today is made practicable in the legislative process,\" Gieseke said in a statement.",

      "title": "EU Carmakers to Comply With 90% Emissions Reduction by 2035 as Full Combustion Engine Ban Scrapped",
      "body": "The remaining 10% of emissions will need to be compensated for by using low-carbon steel 'Made in the EU' or sustainable fuels. The EU executive revoked the 2035 ban on the sale of new cars and vans powered by diesel or petrol after pressure from some EU countries and the automotive industry\n\nEuropean Union-based carmakers will need to comply with a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions from 2035, instead of the 100% previously set in EU law, the European Commission announced today, revoking a controversial wholesale ban on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles adopted in March 2023.\n\nManufacturers will have to compensate for the remaining 10% of emissions by using low-carbon steel produced in the EU or by using sustainable fuels such as e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nThe industry will be allowed to continue producing plug-in hybrids, range extenders, mild hybrids, and ICE vehicles beyond 2035.\n\nFull electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles will also be encouraged, with car manufacturers eligible to receive \"super credits\" for producing small, affordable electric cars made in the EU27, the Commission said.\n\n\"We're staying the course towards zero-emissions mobility, but introducing some flexibilities for manufacturers to meet their CO2 targets in the most cost-efficient way,\" Climate Action Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe new automotive package is a \"win-win\", Hoekstra said, noting that carmakers will have more flexibility while creating a lead market for clean steel.\n\nTransport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas hailed the \"great decision\" to reduce the 2035 target to 90%.\n\n\"This is a clear signal that other technologies than battery electric vehicles can be put on the market after 2035,\" Tzitzikostas added, noting the consumers will have the freedom to decide which technology they want to drive.\n\nDespite some calls within the automotive sector to keep the ban and invest more in electrification, the vast majority of car manufacturers have been urging the EU to rethink its policies, claiming that their businesses are dying in the face of competition from China and the United States.\n\nGermany, Italy, and several other member states have also lobbied the EU executive to withdraw the ban, arguing that the social fabric of their economies, propped up by the automotive industry, is disappearing. They claim their automakers are struggling with high energy prices, a shortage of car components, including batteries, and insufficient consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nGerman automotive giant Volkswagen is expected to stop manufacturing vehicles at its site in Dresden, marking the first time in the carmaker's 88-year history that it will close production in Germany, according to recent media reports.\n\nBulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Slovakia were among the EU countries that asked the Commission to reconsider the 2035 ICE ban and to consider the sale of hybrid vehicles under the law.\n\nFrance and Spain wanted to keep the ban, but asked the EU executive to support domestic production.\n\nCan flexibility and electrification go hand in hand?\n\nVeteran lawmaker Peter Liese of the European People's Party (EPP) welcomed the EU executive's update, saying that technological neutrality and climate neutrality \"are compatible and must be reconciled\".\n\n\"The future belongs to electromobility, and I believe that too. We mustn't slacken our support for electromobility, especially when it comes to expanding the charging infrastructure,\" said Liese.\n\nSigfried de Vries, secretary-general at the automotive lobby group European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, said that \"flexibility was urgent\" but maintained the sector's commitment to decarbonisation.\n\n\"Auto makers have invested hundreds of billions of euros and put over 300 electrified models on the market. There cannot be any question about their commitment,\" said De Vries.\n\nDe Vries welcomed the Commission's flexibility to enable compliance with CO2 reduction targets in the run-up to 2030 and technological neutrality beyond 2035.\n\nChris Heron, secretary general of E-mobility Europe, a trade association lobbying for electric mobility, regretted the Commission's decision, saying it will create more uncertainty for investors.\n\n\"We know the future of transport is electric,\" he said. \"What isn't settled is who will build it. Hesitation or mixed signals risk undermining the investment certainty battery makers, manufacturers and grids need to scale. The message for policymakers is simple: hold the line on ambition and give industry clarity.\"\n\nChanging mindsets\n\nThe decision to ban the sale of new ICE cars and vans by 2035 was part of the European Green Deal, the EU's flagship programme to reach climate neutrality by 2050, which drove Ursula von der Leyen's first mandate as Commission President between 2019 and 2023.\n\nBut the winds changed with the EU elections in 2024. Green lawmakers in the European Parliament suffered a significant blow, and the chamber became dominated by the centre-right EPP and the far-right, with new parties like Patriots for Europe and the Europe of Sovereign Nations increasingly influencing policymaking.\n\nGerman lawmaker Manfred Weber, the EPP's leader, has been among the many centrists opposed to the 2035 ICE ban, claiming it was too early tor the industry to adjust to the transition.\n\nWeber recently told the German media that the EU's intention to open up the law would send an important signal \"to the entire automotive industry and secures tens of thousands of industrial jobs\".\n\nLars Aagaard, the Danish minister for climate, energy and utilities acting on behalf of the Danish EU Presidency, said the review of the ICE ban on cars and vans needs to be aligned with the 2040 climate target.\n\n\"We will analyse the proposal from the Commission. Then I'm looking forward to being a Dane again and we will look into what our position will be,\" Aagaard said on Monday on the sidelines of the Environment Council.\n\nThe Commission proposal will now be negotiated between the European Parliament and the European Council. The incoming EU Cypriot Presidency will mediate political negotiations starting in January 2026.",

      "title": "Drivers May Keep Buying Gas Cars Past 2035 Under New Plan",
      "body": "The mandatory emissions cut for new cars in 2035 is lowered from 100% to 90%.\n\nThe European Union has announced a significant retreat from its landmark climate policy, effectively scrapping the total ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.\n\nIn a move that has stunned environmental campaigners but delighted the automotive industry, the European Commission proposed on Tuesday, 16 December, that the target for reducing tailpipe emissions be lowered from 100 per cent to 90 per cent. This crucial adjustment means that motorists will likely be able to purchase new hybrid vehicles and cars running on synthetic fuels well into the next decade.\n\nThe original plan, agreed upon two years ago, was designed to force a complete switch to electric vehicles (EVs) by making it illegal to sell any new car that emitted carbon dioxide. However, facing stalling sales of electric cars and fierce lobbying from major manufacturing nations like Germany and Italy, Brussels has opted for a 'pragmatic' compromise.\n\nUnder the new rules, manufacturers can continue to sell vehicles with internal combustion engines provided they offset the remaining 10 per cent of emissions through other green measures, such as using 'low-carbon steel' or investing in synthetic 'e-fuels'.\n\nIndustry Pressure And Economic Realities\n\nThe decision follows months of intense pressure from the car industry, which has warned that a strict ban would lead to factory closures and massive job losses across Europe.\n\nMajor carmakers have argued that the charging infrastructure is not ready and that electric cars remain too expensive for many ordinary families. The slowing demand for EVs in 2025 has given weight to these arguments, allowing political leaders to push for a softening of the rules.\n\nFriedrich Merz, the German Chancellor, has been a vocal critic of the outright ban, arguing that Europe must remain open to different technologies. His government, alongside the Italian administration, has successfully argued that a 'technology neutral' approach is better for the economy. They believe that advanced plug-in hybrids, cars that have both an electric battery and a petrol engine, should play a role in the transition, rather than being outlawed entirely.\n\nWhat This Means For Drivers\n\nFor the average driver, this change ensures more choice in the showroom after 2035. While electric vehicles will still be the main focus for manufacturers, the new '90 per cent' target allows for the continued sale of plug-in hybrids. These cars can drive on electric power for short city trips but switch to a petrol engine for longer motorway journeys, eliminating the 'range anxiety' that still worries many buyers.\n\nThe loophole for 'e-fuels' (synthetic petrol made from captured carbon and hydrogen) means that traditional sports cars and luxury vehicles with combustion engines could technically remain on sale. However, experts warn that these fuels are currently very expensive to produce. This suggests that while petrol cars may survive, running them could become a luxury reserved for the wealthy, while most drivers will still be pushed towards electric options by market forces.\n\nAnger From Environmental Groups\n\nThe announcement has sparked outrage among climate activists and Green party politicians, who have labelled the decision a 'betrayal' of the European Green Deal. Critics argue that allowing petrol and diesel engines to stay on the road for longer will make it nearly impossible for the continent to meet its climate goals for 2050.\n\nTransport & Environment, a leading campaign group, stated that the '90 per cent' target creates a permanent pollution loophole. They fear that by relaxing the rules, the EU is condemning future generations to dirtier air and delaying the necessary shift to clean transport. Despite this opposition, the proposal is expected to pass, as the political wind in Europe has shifted towards protecting industry and jobs in the face of tough economic competition from China and the United States.",

      "title": "EU weakens car goal | Coal decline forecast | Trump 'to dismantle' NCAR - Carbon Brief",
      "body": "EU walks back 2035 all-electric target, permitting some new combustion engine cars\n\nThe EU has \"walked back\" its 2035 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, reports Agence France-Presse. Car manufacturers will now only have to cut greenhouse gas emissions from new vehicles to 90% below 2021 levels by 2035, rather than the previously planned 100%, the outlet explains. The Guardian notes that, in practice, the new proposal from the European Commission allows for the continued production of \"a portion of plug-in hybrid electric cars, or even combustion engines beyond 2035\". In what the newspaper describes as \"a carrot-and-stick approach\", the remaining 10% of vehicles will need to be compensated by other \"green measures\", such as the use of green steel or biofuels in non-electric vehicles.\n\nDeutsche Welle says pressure from car manufacturers, \"sluggish EV [electric vehicle] adoption\" and \"massive competition from China\" all contributed to the decision. [European EV sales are up 33% year-on-year in 2025 to date.] Conversely, BBC News notes that opponents of the move argue \"it risks undermining the transition towards electric vehicles and leaving the EU exposed in the face of foreign competition\". In a piece capturing responses to the new policy, Reuters notes that the car industry itself is \"divided\" on the issue, with some companies in favour and some against.\n\nThe Daily Mail describes the move as a \"major climbdown\" by the EU and states that it \"heaps fresh pressure on the UK government to reconsider its deadline\". The UK already plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars five years earlier than the EU in 2030, explains the Times. [It does not mention that the UK will allow hybrids to be sold until 2035.] The Daily Telegraph frames the EU's decision as part of a \"pro-business push that has seen it pare back environmental laws this year, claiming they risk weighing on growth\". Bloomberg says UK consumers have \"embraced electric cars more quickly than most of Europe\", including Chinese EVs.",

      "title": "Exclusive: EU Commissioner backs scrapping 2035 combustion engine ban",
      "body": "Climate Commissioner Hoekstra defended scrapping the landmark proposal to ban combustion-engine cars, calling it \"a smart, wise compromise for climate and competitiveness.\" Meanwhile, critics say Brussels is backtracking on its green agenda.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Climate Wopke Hoekstra defended a controversial decision to drop a planned ban of combustion-engine vehicles from 2035, calling it a \"smart and wise compromise\" for both climate and industry in an interview with Euronews.\n\nHis comments follow the European Commission's announcement on Tuesday that it would roll back a proposal to entirely ban the sale of cars powered by combustion engines from 2035.\n\nInstead, the executive said the ban would apply to 90% of new cars, down from 100%. The extra leeway could allow more polluting vehicles to enter the market.\n\nEuropean automakers, facing a perfect storm as a result of higher energy costs, tariffs and fierce competition from China, had called for flexibility from the Commission.\n\nMeanwhile, climate activists lashed out at the executive for bowing to industry at the expense of the Green Deal, which they argue is being erased. Hoekstra said neither is true.\n\n\"We want to help this hugely important industry (autos) not just survive but thrive. But this is going to be absolutely climate neutral,\" Hoekstra told Euronews.\n\n\"The only thing that we are doing is introducing a provision that allows companies to continue to sell hybrids, for example, and compensate the emissions by using green steel. That's a win for both.\"\n\nStill under fire\n\nThe Commission continues to face criticism from climate associations who argue that the executive is actively going against its own green policies introduced under Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's first term, in which she referred to the Green Deal as \"Europe's man on the Moon moment\" and the centerpiece of its future growth strategy.\n\nIn her second mandate, von der Leyen has pivoted toward competitiveness, vowing to cut red tape, ease bureaucracy and roll back excessive regulation.\n\nThe new political direction of the Commission, shaped mainly by industry demands, has sparked concerns among climate groups who suggest the Green Deal has been abandoned.\n\nCommissioner Hoekstra, who hails from the Netherlands, told Euronews that the Green Deal remains a \"compass\" for Europe, but the recipe will have to be adapted.\n\n\"The name of the game is we must do the utmost for our competitiveness, climate and our independence,\" he said. \"Always in combination, not the expense of the other. If the world changes, the recipe cannot be the same, right?\"\n\nThe proposal still needs to be agreed upon by European lawmakers and EU governments. Hoekstra said he expects to gather broad political support for it.\n\nThe centre-right EPP, which brings together most mainstream conservative forces including Germany's CDU, welcomed the move. Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who leads one of a handful of left-leaning governments in Europe, called scrapping the complete ban a \"mistake\" on Wednesday.\n\nBulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Slovakia were the EU countries that asked the Commission to reconsider the 2035 ban on combustion engines.\n\nMeanwhile, France and Spain were among the countries backing the ban and urging EU leaders to \"stay on track,\" saying that zero-emissions vehicles are \"indispensable,\" according to a letter seen by Euronews.\n\nHowever, Paris and Madrid called on lawmakers to include hybrid vehicles and fiscal incentives for domestic automakers.\n\nCars at the centre of 'emotional debate'\n\nHoekstra acknowledges that balancing the need for a competitive European economy at a time when the Trump administration is imposing tariffs and China is growing more assertive in high-tech sectors, with an ambitious climate policy, has become for some a deeply political and emotional debate.\n\nThe automotive sector stands out more than any other in Europe, as it is widely regarded as highly strategic for exports and jobs in countries like Germany, but it is also very energy-dependent and remains one of the top sources of pollution in Europe.\n\nHoekstra conceded that \"not everyone will be pleased\" but noted that's \"part of politics\".\n\nAsked if he had personally come under pressure from the German government, which had expressed a desire the drop the ban, he denied a single actor played a definitive role, but a combination of factors.\n\n\"You have to what is wise, intelligent and good for Europe in the long run,\" he said, adding that the measure has to be seen as part of a package.\n\nUnder the new legislative proposal on CO2 emissions in cars, the EU executive said the bloc's manufacturers will have to offset the remaining 10% of emissions by using low-carbon steel produced in the EU or sustainable fuels such as e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nFull-electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles will also be encouraged, with car manufacturers eligible to receive \"super credits\" for producing small, affordable electric cars made in the EU, according to the Commission's proposal.\n\n\"There needs to be a political landing zone, because no one will like all the elements,\" Hoekstra said, \"But many will see that the package, with green steel, added flexibilities, climate neutrality, and a combination of element, is a winner for Europe.\"",

      "title": "The future of driving takes an unexpected turn",
      "body": "The moves also sharpen the contrast between the West and China, which has developed a massive and lucrative EV market supplied by state-backed automakers.\n\nIn the US, where President Donald Trump has portrayed electric cars as an expensive \"scam\", the White House has cut EV incentives and this month announced plans to weaken fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks.\n\nEuropean officials say they favour a future that is mostly electric, and many countries still have EV incentives in place.\n\nBrussels faced intense pressure from the continent's automakers to dilute the 2035 ban.\n\nThose legacy carmakers, with huge workforces and factories built around combustion engines, have struggled to compete with China's low-cost, high-quality EVs.\n\nThe revised proposal will force carmakers to meet 90% fleetwide emissions reductions compared with 2021 levels.\n\nThat means most vehicles will be fully electric. But it also leaves room for hybrids - including those with a plug-in option - and fuel vehicles.\n\n\"We're introducing some flexibilities for manufacturers,\" the EU's climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, said at a news conference.\n\nWhile there remain good reasons to revere the petrol-powered car - its history, its motor-revving power - passenger cars and vans account for about 10% of the global carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nCutting emissions in other sectors, such as shipping or aviation, require huge and technically difficult transformations. With cars, the technology is already available.\n\nFerdinand Dudenhoffer, the director of the Centre Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany, said he sees the world's auto industry splintering into three parts.\n\nOne in the US, fully supportive of fuel cars. One in China, all in on EVs. And another in Europe, where policies are now muddled.\n\nHe said Chinese automakers are likely to benefit most from that dynamic, because the Chinese market dwarfs those in the US and Europe and looks to keep growing - and electrifying.\n\nAmerican and European markets have had a hard time splitting from the petrol-powered vehicles, because combustion engines have higher profit margins.\n\nThat strategy leaves them in a long-term bind.\n\n\"In the future, China will define the rules of the car industry,\" Dudenhoffer said.\n\nWith a licence to keep producing petrol vehicles, he said, Western manufacturers \"earn some kind of short-term windfall. But in the long term, they lose a lot.\n\n\"The advantages of the Chinese carmakers will be larger and larger.\"\n\nFord, in its announcement, said it was seeking out \"higher-return opportunities\" by expanding petrol and hybrid options. It said it would put a hold on production of its flagship EV, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nCarmakers such as Volvo and Porsche have also pulled back from more ambitious EV plans. Earlier this year, Stellantis, which includes the Jeep and Fiat brands, shifted away from plans to be fully electric in Europe by 2030.\n\nThe petrol vehicle ban had been a cornerstone of Europe's much-heralded climate plan, introduced four years ago as officials cited the \"generational task\" of saving the planet.\n\nAt the time, EU leaders said they had put the continent's car industry - which accounts for 7% of Europe's gross domestic product - at the forefront of innovation by creating a clear future target.\n\nOfficials also had reasoned that a 2035 ban would allow an additional 15 years to phase out older petrol and diesel vehicles from the roads, in line with the EU's goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nBut large automakers - including Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW - have seen their market value nose-dive. In a strategic error, the EVs they produced tended to be high-end, not for the mass market.\n\nWhen the European Parliament shifted rightward in elections last year, the momentum to water down the 2035 policy grew. In the meantime, leaders in Germany and Italy described the target as a danger to European jobs.\n\n\"Such a hard cutoff in 2035 will not take place, if I have anything to do with it,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had said.\n\nMatthias Schmidt, an auto industry analyst, said that high-end automakers like Porsche, BMW and Mercedes had struggled to make the case for EVs.\n\n\"Their core customer base has been more interested in the mechanical prowess and the engineering of a sports car,\" Schmidt said. \"This gives them a licence to continue going forward.\"\n\nEuropean carmakers are also now rolling out more affordable EV models. But the fastest-growing EV seller on the continent - though starting from a small scale - is Chinese company BYD, which saw sales skyrocket 300% in the first nine months this year, according to industry data.\n\nEuropean automakers also rely on components made in China, given its dominance in batteries and in the crucial minerals that go into them.\n\nThe plan unveiled yesterday by the European Commission stated that fleet emissions from 2035 onward would need to be \"compensated\" with other measures, such as the use of low-carbon steel made within the bloc. E-fuels or biofuels could also be used.\n\nThe proposal must still be discussed and approved by the European Parliament and by EU member states.\n\nStephane Sejourne, the EU's commissioner for industrial policy, said Europe was not abandoning its decarbonisation plans.\n\n\"We're taking a pragmatic approach to the economic and geopolitical situation,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the European Green Party blasted the move to weaken the target and said it was undermining Europe's long-term climate goals.\n\n\"Climate neutrality cannot be achieved with half-measures or loopholes for polluting technologies,\" said Vula Tsetsi, the party's co-chair.",

It also responds to calls by EU industry to simplify rules\".\n\n\"Today's package maintains a strong market signal for zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) while giving the industry more flexibility to achieve CO targets, and supports vehicles and batteries made in the European Union,\" the executive arm of the bloc added.\n\nUnder the proposal, the target for new cars and vans would shift to a 90% reduction in CO emissions from 2021 levels by 2035, replacing the current requirement for all new vehicles to be zero-emission from that date.\n\nManufacturers would be able to offset residual emissions through measures including the use of lower-carbon steel produced in the EU and synthetic e-fuels or non-food biofuels, including those made from agricultural waste and used cooking oil.\n\nThe draft also provides a three-year window from 2030 to 2032 for carmakers to achieve a 55% reduction in fleet-average CO emissions from 2021 levels.\n\nThe 2030 goal for vans would be reduced to 40% from 50% as the EV uptake in the van segment has been \"structurally more difficult\".\n\nGermany and Italy, home to major automotive industries, had pressed for looser rules.\n\nThe Commission also put forward a targeted change to CO standards for heavy-duty vehicles, adding flexibility to make meeting the 2030 targets easier.\n\nFor corporate fleets, the proposal would impose member state-level mandates to encourage large companies to adopt zero- and low-emission vehicles.\n\nCommission President von der Leyen said: \"Innovation. Clean mobility. Competitiveness. This year, these were top priorities in our intense dialogues with automotive sector, civil society organisations and stakeholders.\n\n\"And today, we are addressing them all together.

      "body": "The European Commission on Tuesday made public proposals that reverse an effective ban on sales of new internal combustion engine cars from 2035, bowing to pressure from Germany, Italy and major automakers.\n\nThe delayed package follows fierce lobbying to allow transitional technologies such as plug-in hybrids and CO2-neutral fuels, while climate campaigners and EV-focused companies had pushed to keep the original target.\n\nThe revised package cuts the planned 2035 goal to a 90 per cent reduction in tailpipe emissions compared with 2021, and also introduces measures to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles while giving manufacturers more flexibility.\n\nHere are the main changes:\n\nC02 revisions\n\nUnder the plan, automakers will still be able to sell plug-in hybrids and range extenders beyond 2035. Those not hitting the 100 per cent CO2 emission reduction need to make up the shortfall.\n\nCO2-neutral fuels, including advanced biofuels made from waste, such as used cooking oil and low-carbon steel will also be factored into emissions calculations, meaning automakers who produce cars with this lower carbon \"green steel\" made in the EU can help cut emissions figures further.\n\nAutomakers using these 'flexibilities' cannot then pool their emissions with those of EV-only brands such as Tesla and Polestar to hit the targets.\n\nCorporate fleet\n\nCorporate fleets, which account for about 60 per cent of new car sales in Europe, will face binding electrification targets based on member states' GDP per capita, although small and medium-sized enterprises with less than 250 employees and below 50 million euros of turnover will be exempt.\n\nMember states will only provide financial support for clean vehicles made in the EU, a win for France, which pushed for local production incentives.\n\nElectrifying fleets could help build a second-hand EV market, as rental firms typically keep cars for a year and leasing companies for about three years.\n\nNational market share targets are set to range 32 per cent of zero-emission cars in 2035 for Bulgaria to 100 per cent for many richer countries.\n\n'SUPER CREDITS' FOR NEW SMALL EV CATEGORY\n\nThe Commission will create a new category for small electric cars under 4.2 metres in length, similar to Japan's \"kei cars\".\n\nThese vehicles will qualify for \"super-credits\" in emissions targets up to 2034, with each sale counting 1.3 times, meaning 10 small EVs would be credited as 13.\n\nThis category could also be used for other targeted simplification measures from the member states as well as on the EU level.\n\nRenault and Stellantis have been lobbying the EU for a new class of small cars, arguing that it would cut costs and make EVs more affordable.\n\nVans\n\nBy 2030, commercial vehicles such as vans will face a 40 per cent emissions reduction target, down from the previous 50 per cent.\n\nAutomakers will also be allowed to average compliance over a three-year period from 2030 to 2032, giving them more flexibility.\n\nBattery booster pack\n\nThe package also includes a new battery booster pack, which will have financial support as Europe races to scale gigafactories and compete with China. The Commission will inject 1.8 billion euros to accelerate Europe's battery value chain, including 1.5 billion euros in interest-free loans for battery cell producers.\n\nThe upcoming Industrial Accelerator Act, due in January, is seen as key to the battery booster as it will include details around prioritising local content.",

      "title": "When the plug gets pulled: Policy, demand drag EVs",
      "body": "Automakers are now stretching timelines and leaning towards hybrids, reflecting a more pragmatic and uneven path forward for electrification, driven by consumer economics and evolving political priorities.\n\nAs the global auto industry approaches 2026, electric vehicles, once positioned as the uncontested future of mobility, are facing uncertainty. Regulatory policy shifts and slowing demand in key markets are converging to test the resilience of EV strategies worldwide. While electrification remains important everywhere, the pace, shape and profitability of the transition are uncertain across regions. From policy rollbacks in Europe and the United States to subsidy fatigue in China and affordability challenges in India, EVs are increasingly caught between political priorities and consumer economics.\n\nThe early 2020s marked an era of exuberant EV investment, driven by aggressive climate targets, generous subsidies and optimistic demand forecasts. Automakers committed hundreds of billions of dollars. But by late 2025, the momentum seems to be slowing. Governments are reassessing green policies amid industrial pressure and voter concerns, while consumers, who face cost-of-living pressures, are becoming more cautious about big-ticket EV purchases.\n\nThe result is not rejection of electrification but a shift. Carmakers are stretching timelines, scaling back pure battery-electric offerings and leaning more heavily on hybrids, plug-in hybrids and range-extended electric vehicles. These technologies offer emissions reductions without fully abandoning combustion engines, aligning better with shifting policies and uneven demand.\n\nEurope's EV push has long been anchored in regulation, particularly the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. That clarity gave automakers a clear deadline around which to plan investments. The European Commission's latest proposal to soften this ban is a turning point.\n\nThe European Commission unveiled a plan on Tuesday to drop the EU's effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035 after pressure from the region's auto sector, marking the bloc's biggest retreat from its green policies in recent years. The move, which still needs approval from EU governments and the European Parliament, would allow continued sales of some non-electric vehicles. Carmakers in regional industrial powerhouse Germany and in Italy had sought easing of the rules. The EU executive appears to have bowed to calls from carmakers to keep selling plug-in hybrids and range extenders that burn fuel as they struggle to compete against Tesla and Chinese electric vehicle makers. Under Tuesday's proposal, EU targets would shift to a 90 per cent cut in CO2 emissions from 2021 levels, instead of current rules that all new cars and vans from 2035 have zero emissions. By allowing some non-electric vehicles beyond 2035 and shifting targets to a 90 per cent CO\u2082 reduction rather than zero emissions, Brussels has signaled a willingness to compromise.\n\nThis retreat reflects mounting pressure from Europe's auto industry, especially in Germany and Italy, where manufacturers are struggling to compete with Tesla and fast-moving Chinese EV makers. High production costs, slower-than-expected consumer uptake and intensifying global competition have weakened the business case for an all-in battery-electric strategy. Allowing plug-in hybrids and range extenders offers automakers breathing room, enabling them to meet emissions goals while preserving margins and manufacturing flexibility.\n\nFor EVs, however, the policy shift introduces uncertainty. The dilution of long-term mandates risks slowing infrastructure investment and dampening consumer confidence, especially in markets where EV adoption still depends heavily on regulatory support rather than pure cost competitiveness.\n\nIn the US, EVs are facing a sharper and more abrupt reversal. The Trump administration's rollback of federal support has fundamentally altered the economics of electric cars. The expiration of the long-standing $7,500 consumer tax credit and the easing of tailpipe emissions rules have removed key demand drivers almost overnight. The freeze on fuel-economy fines has further reduced regulatory pressure on automakers to prioritize EVs.\n\nThe impact on sales has been dramatic, with US EV volumes dropping sharply toward the end of 2025. Automakers that ramped up production in anticipation of sustained growth are now competing for a shrinking pool of buyers.\n\nThe EU move follows on the heels of US carmaker Ford Motor announcing on Monday a $19.5 billion writedown as it axes several EV models. It is the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry's retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration's policies and weakening EV demand. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will replace the fully electric F-150 Lightning with a new extended-range electric model that uses a gas-powered engine to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.\n\nFord's shift reflects the auto industry's response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook for electrics dimmed significantly this year as Trump's policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars. US sales of electric vehicles fell about 40 per cent in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand.\n\nThe Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations. The recent dropoff in US EV sales leaves automakers that hurried electric models to market competing over a shrinking pool of buyers. Like Ford, many traditional automakers are rotating back to gas and hybrid models, while narrowing their EV offerings to shore up losses in that space.\n\nGeneral Motors took a $1.6 billion charge in October as it adjusted its EV factory plans, and warned that it would likely take more charges in the future. Stellantis has also backtracked on some of its EV plans, axing a scheduled electric Ram pickup truck and leaning into hybrids. Some traditional automakers' move to hybrids follows the lead of Toyota Motor, the longtime market leader on hybrid models, which emphasized the technology even during the industry's EV euphoria.\n\nChina remains the world's largest EV market, but it too is entering a more challenging phase. Years of generous subsidies, tax exemptions and industrial policy support created explosive growth, but also intense competition and overcapacity. As Beijing gradually withdraws financial incentives, the market is showing signs of strain.\n\nThe expected reduction in trade-in subsidies and the reintroduction of purchase taxes for EVs from January 2026 are likely to cool demand after a year-end surge. Forecasts already point to a rare decline in EV sales next year, marking a turning point after half a decade of uninterrupted growth. Consumers rushing to buy before incentives expire may leave a demand vacuum in early 2026.\n\nMainland China EV sales are likely to drop in 2026, the first decline since 2020, if Beijing stops granting cash subsidies and tax incentives to buyers, according to a JPMorgan Chase forecast. Given a likely surge in EV sales before the end of 2025 and lower government support for EVs, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) will cut its full-year forecasts for 2026 and 2027 to 14 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, from previously expected levels of 16 per cent and 5 per cent. Based on these revisions, the five-year compound annual growth rate for EV sales in China will fall from 12 per cent to 8 per cent.\n\nThe government's clampdown on aggressive discounting highlights deeper structural problems. Price wars driven by weak demand and excess capacity have eroded profitability across the sector. While new rules aim to curb below-cost pricing, they do little to address the underlying imbalance between supply and demand. For many Chinese EV makers, especially smaller players, the next phase will be about survival rather than expansion.\n\nIndia stands out as a relative bright spot, with EV registrations continuing to rise and surpassing previous annual records in 2025. Yet beneath the headline growth, penetration remains low and highly sensitive to pricing. The Indian EV market is still largely dependent on policy support and a favorable cost comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles.\n\nThat balance has been disrupted by the September GST cut on petrol and diesel cars. By lowering ICE vehicle prices, the government inadvertently widened the affordability gap with EVs, undermining the total cost of ownership argument that had driven much of the recent adoption. In a price-sensitive market like India, even small shifts in upfront cost can significantly affect consumer behaviour.\n\nThe response from automakers, which are now offering deep discounts on EV models, highlights the fragility of demand. While long-term prospects remain strong given urban pollution concerns and energy security goals as well as affordability, India's EV transition is proving vulnerable to short-term policy changes and competitive pricing dynamics.\n\nAcross key markets in the world, a common pattern is emerging. EVs are no longer advancing on a straight, policy-driven trajectory. Instead, the transition is becoming slower, more uneven and more closely tied to economic realities. Governments are rethinking support, automakers are hedging bets with hybrids and range extenders, and consumers are weighing costs more carefully in an uncertain global economy.\n\nElectric vehicles remain central to the future of the automotive industry, but the events of 2025 show that the path forward will be more pragmatic and uneven. Success in the next phase will depend less on bold targets and policy support, and more on affordability, infrastructure, supply-chain resilience and technologies that bridge the gap between combustion engines and full electrification.",

Well, while the previous plan saw only pure-electric and hydrogen cars allowed to be sold from new in the EU after 2035, the new revision enables manufacturers to consider selling plug-in, full and mild-hybrid, as well as old-school internal combustion petrol and diesel models past this date.\n\nThe catch is that these types of vehicle can only account for 10 per cent of sales; manufacturers will be required to offset the emissions from these cars by utilising low-carbon steel during manufacturing, or by powering their cars with e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nFurthermore, in the lead up to 2035 manufacturers will be able to make use of so-called 'super credits' for small electric cars; these models (measuring under 4.3 metres in length) will each count as 1.3 vehicles against manufacturing quotas, enabling manufacturers to effectively 'bank' progress towards emissions targets.",

      "body": "The delayed package follows fierce lobbying to allow transitional technologies such as plug-in hybrids and CO2-neutral fuels, while climate campaigners and EV-focused companies had pushed to keep the original target.\n\nThe revised package cuts the planned 2035 goal to a 90 per cent reduction in tailpipe emissions compared with 2021, and also introduces measures to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles while giving manufacturers more flexibility.\n\nHere are the main changes:\n\nUnder the plan, automakers will still be able to sell plug-in hybrids and range extenders beyond 2035. Those not hitting the 100 per cent CO2 emission reduction need to make up the shortfall.\n\nCO2-neutral fuels, including advanced biofuels made from waste, such as used cooking oil and low-carbon steel will also be factored into emissions calculations, meaning automakers who produce cars with this lower carbon \"green steel\" made in the EU can help cut emissions figures further.\n\nAutomakers using these 'flexibilities' cannot then pool their emissions with those of EV-only brands such as Tesla and Polestar to hit the targets.\n\nCorporate fleets, which account for about 60 per cent of new car sales in Europe, will face binding electrification targets based on member states' GDP per capita, although small and medium-sized enterprises with less than 250 employees and below 50 million euros of turnover will be exempt.\n\nMember states will only provide financial support for clean vehicles made in the EU, a win for France, which pushed for local production incentives.\n\nElectrifying fleets could help build a second-hand EV market, as rental firms typically keep cars for a year and leasing companies for about three years.\n\nNational market share targets are set to range 32 per cent of zero-emission cars in 2035 for Bulgaria to 100 per cent for many richer countries.\n\n'SUPER CREDITS' FOR NEW SMALL EV CATEGORY\n\nThe Commission will create a new category for small electric cars under 4.2 metres in length, similar to Japan's \"kei cars\".\n\nThese vehicles will qualify for \"super-credits\" in emissions targets up to 2034, with each sale counting 1.3 times, meaning 10 small EVs would be credited as 13.\n\nThis category could also be used for other targeted simplification measures from the member states as well as on the EU level.\n\nRenault and Stellantis have been lobbying the EU for a new class of small cars, arguing that it would cut costs and make EVs more affordable.\n\nBy 2030, commercial vehicles such as vans will face a 40 per cent emissions reduction target, down from the previous 50 per cent.\n\nAutomakers will also be allowed to average compliance over a three-year period from 2030 to 2032, giving them more flexibility.\n\nThe package also includes a new battery booster pack, which will have financial support as Europe races to scale gigafactories and compete with China. The Commission will inject 1.8 billion euros to accelerate Europe's battery value chain, including 1.5 billion euros in interest-free loans for battery cell producers.\n\nThe upcoming Industrial Accelerator Act, due in January, is seen as key to the battery booster as it will include details around prioritising local content.",

      "title": "EU Automotive Package eases CO2 emission standards to drive EV transition",
      "body": "The European automotive sector has long been a pillar of industrial strength, supporting millions of jobs and anchoring innovation across the continent.\n\nBut with global competition intensifying and technologies evolving rapidly, the European Commission says a policy reset is needed.\n\nIts newly presented Automotive Package responds directly to manufacturers' calls for clearer rules, lower administrative burdens, and greater flexibility - while reinforcing Europe's commitment to ambitious CO2 emission standards.\n\nThe package aims to balance environmental targets with industrial resilience, ensuring the EU remains both climate-neutral and strategically independent.\n\nSt\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, Executive Vice-President for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy, explained: \"This package will be a lifeline for the European automotive industry.\n\n\"We are pulling every lever at our disposal - simplification, flexibility, European preference, targeted support and innovation.\n\n\"Together, these measures are our commitment to restoring Europe's industrial leadership while leading the global transition on climate.\n\nAt the heart of the initiative is a renewed commitment to clean transport. The Commission has kept a strong market signal in favour of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), while reshaping how carmakers comply with CO2 emission standards across different vehicle categories.\n\nThe updated framework addresses both supply and demand. On the supply side, it revises CO2 emission standards for cars, vans and heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nOn the demand side, it introduces binding national targets to accelerate the uptake of zero- and low-emission corporate fleets - an area seen as critical due to high annual mileages and faster turnover into the second-hand market.\n\nOne of the most significant changes concerns how manufacturers meet emissions targets in the years ahead.\n\nFrom 2035, carmakers will be required to achieve a 90% reduction in tailpipe emissions. The remaining 10% can be offset through approved measures such as the use of low-carbon steel produced in the EU, or alternative fuels, including e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nThis approach introduces greater technological neutrality. Rather than mandating a single solution, it allows a mix of powertrains, such as plug-in hybrids, range extenders, mild hybrids, and advanced internal combustion engines, to coexist alongside battery-electric and hydrogen vehicles beyond 2035.\n\nIn the run-up to that deadline, manufacturers gain additional flexibility. 'Super credits' will reward the production of small, affordable electric vehicles made in the EU, encouraging broader consumer access to electric mobility.\n\nFor the 2030 targets, a 'banking and borrowing' mechanism will allow manufacturers to balance emissions performance between 2030 and 2032.\n\nRecognising structural challenges in the commercial sector, the Commission has also lowered the 2030 CO2 reduction target for vans from 50% to 40%.\n\nHeavy-duty vehicles play a vital role in Europe's logistics and industrial supply chains. The package includes a targeted amendment to CO2 emission standards for trucks and buses, easing compliance with 2030 targets while preserving long-term decarbonisation goals.\n\nThe Commission argues this pragmatic adjustment will help manufacturers scale up cleaner technologies without disrupting freight operations or inflating costs.\n\nTo stimulate demand, the Automotive Package introduces mandatory national targets for zero- and low-emission vehicles in large corporate fleets. Public financial support will increasingly be tied to low-emission vehicles that are 'Made in the EU.'\n\nBy prioritising cleaner corporate vehicles, the policy is expected to accelerate emissions reductions while improving access to affordable low-emission cars in the second-hand market.\n\nClean mobility depends on secure battery supply chains. To reduce reliance on dominant global players, the Commission has announced a \u20ac1.8bn 'Battery Booster' initiative.\n\nOf this, \u20ac1.5bn will be allocated as interest-free loans to European battery cell producers. The programme also includes coordinated policy measures to strengthen upstream supply chains, encourage innovation and build a resilient, EU-based battery ecosystem.\n\nThe Automotive Omnibus, another core element of the package, focuses on simplification. By reducing administrative burdens and streamlining vehicle testing procedures, the Commission estimates manufacturers will save around \u20ac706m per year.\n\nMeasures include fewer secondary regulations, harmonised labelling rules for vehicle emissions, and equal treatment of electric vans under drivers' rest-time regulations.\n\nA new vehicle category for small, affordable electric cars - up to 4.2 metres in length - will also allow targeted incentives at the local and national level.\n\nThe EU automotive sector has welcomed the package following a long process of calling on the EU to support the industry.\n\nSigrid de Vries, Director General of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), said: \"These proposals rightly recognise the need for more flexibility and technology neutrality to make the green transition a success. This constitutes a major change compared to the current law.\n\n\"However, the devil can be very much in the details. We will now study the package and work with co-legislators to critically strengthen the proposals where needed.\"\n\nBy reshaping CO2 emission standards while backing European manufacturing, the Commission hopes to chart a realistic path to climate neutrality.\n\nThe Automotive Package signals continuity in ambition, but with added flexibility, investment support and regulatory clarity designed to keep Europe's car industry competitive in a fast-changing world.",

      "body": "AFP | Brussels\n\nEmail : editor@newsofbahrain.com\n\nThe European Union looks set to scrap a landmark 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars on Tuesday, as part of a package of reforms aimed at supporting Europe's embattled auto industry.\n\nThe ban was hailed as a major win in the fight against climate change when it was adopted in 2023, but carmakers and their backers have lobbied hard over the past year for Brussels to relax it, in the face of fierce competition from China and a slower-than-expected shift to electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nThe European Commission is expected to propose replacing the ban with a less ambitious 90-percent emissions-reduction target, a move critics say risks undermining the EU's green agenda and deterring investments in electrification.\n\nBut talks within the commission were going down to the wire ahead of an official announcement on Tuesday afternoon on what vehicles would be allowed to be sold after the deadline, according to EU sources.\n\n\"This is a critical milestone for the future of the sector. There is a lot at stake,\" Sigrid de Vries, the head of European auto lobby ACEA, told a press conference in Brussels on Monday, referring to the expected reforms. The ban was a cornerstone of the EU's environmental Green Deal, which has come under increased pressure from businesses and right-wing politicians as Europe seeks to bolster its industry.\n\n\"There is a clear demand for more flexibility on the CO2 targets,\" commission spokeswoman Paula Pinho told a press conference Friday, saying Brussels was \"aiming for balance\".\n\nCarmakers argue the 2035 goal to have only electric vehicles sold in Europe, and an intermediate 2030 target, are no longer realistic.\n\nHigh upfront costs and the lack of adequate charging infrastructure in parts of the 27-nation bloc mean consumers have been slow to warm to EVs, producers say.\n\nJust over 16% of new vehicles sold in the first nine months of 2025 run on batteries, according to ACEA.\n\nAutomakers would like to see continued sales authorised for plug-in hybrids or those equipped with range extenders -- small combustion engines that recharge the battery instead of powering the wheels.\n\nGermany and some eastern European nations support this -- despite questions about the vehicles' green credentials, with a recent report indicating that plug-in hybrids pollute almost as much as petrol cars.\n\n'Poisoning the debate'\n\nOthers, like Italy, want to see the use of alternative fuels such as those derived from agricultural crops and waste products allowed.\n\nThat was a sticking point in talks on Tuesday morning, a commission source told AFP.\n\nEnvironmental groups oppose a massive take-up of biofuels, saying it would likely boost the use of pesticides, soil depletion and deforestation.\n\nManfred Weber, the conservative head of the EU parliament's largest group, welcomed the new 90-percent emissions-reduction target, but said no engine should be banned, leaving the choice with consumers.\n\n\"Forbidding technologies\" was a gift to far-right populists, he told a press conference.\n\nThe expected lowering of ambitions is set to displease the Nordic countries, Spain and to an extent France, who have long called for keeping to the planned trajectory in order not to harm firms that have invested in the transition to electric vehicles.\n\nBut William Todts, director of the clean-transport advocacy group T&E, said he hoped obtaining concessions would help the auto industry move on and stay the course towards a green transition. \"I hope that if they get a little bit of what they want, they will stop poisoning the political debate,\" he told AFP, arguing heated discussions had created confusion in the sector and among consumers.\n\nThe commission is also expected to unveil additional measures to support the sector, including plans for \"greening\" company fleets and encouraging production of small and \"affordable\" EVs.",

      "title": "EU Decision to Cancel 2035 Combustion Engine Ban Leaves Automakers at Odds",
      "body": "In March 2021, Volvo said it would go fully electric by the end of the decade. However, the lofty EV goal was dropped in September 2024, when the Geely-owned company said plug-in hybrids would stick around for a little while beyond 2030. Despite getting cold feet, the automaker headquartered in Gothenburg was adamant that the European Union should maintain its goal of banning the sales of new cars with combustion engines from 2035.\n\nWhen news broke yesterday that the European Commission had proposed a package allowing new ICE cars past the originally announced cut-off date, Volvo wasn't exactly happy. A company spokesperson told Automotive News Europe that reverting the ban could do more harm than good, as the decision \"risks undermining Europe's competitiveness for years to come.\"\n\nAdditionally, it believes other automakers would have been able to adapt their portfolios to an EV-only lineup by 2035 had the ban remained unchanged: \"Volvo has built a complete EV portfolio in less than ten years and is ready to go full electric with a bridge of long-range hybrids. If we can do it, others can as well.\"\n\nKia is also an advocate of dropping conventional powertrains. In August, the company's CEO in Europe, Marc Hedrich, said blocking the path toward a purely electric lineup would have significant repercussions: \"We have an avalanche of electric cars coming, and if we suddenly have to stop launching EVs, it would cost us a fortune.\"\n\nBut Volvo and Kia are in the minority, as other automakers support the EC's decisions this week. Reuters cites Volkswagen calling the proposal \"pragmatic\" and \"economically sound overall,\" while Renault saluted the updated package, particularly the Small Affordable Cars initiative for electric models.\n\nThe Small Affordable Cars initiative is designed to create a new subcategory of vehicles (\"M1E\") up to 4.2 meters (165.3 inches) in length, incentivizing automakers to develop and build EVs in Europe. Some regulatory constraints will be relaxed to lower manufacturing and selling prices. Automakers will earn \"super credits\" to help them meet emissions targets.\n\nBMW has mixed feelings about the decisions taken this week. On the one hand, it supports keeping combustion engines in use beyond 2035. On the other hand, forcing increasingly tighter CO emissions regulations is deemed a \"superficial fix.\"\n\nStellantis hasn't issued a response yet, but only a month ago, it made its stance clear, stating that new ICE cars should continue to be produced after 2035. Similarly, Mercedes CEO and President of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) recently urged the European Commission to drop the ban. Ola K\u00e4llenius sent a letter to EC President Ursula von der Leyen, warning her that the 2035 target was unrealistic.\n\nACEA issued a statement a few hours ago, describing the decision to walk back the ban as a \"first step to creating a more pragmatic and flexible pathway to align decarbonization with competitiveness and resilience objectives.\" However, it cautions that additional measures are needed to ease the transition to EVs.\n\nToyota, the world's largest carmaker for the fifth year in a row, has perhaps been the most vocal opponent of banning combustion engines. Chairman Akio Toyoda famously said in 2024 that EVs would never exceed a 30 percent global market share. Earlier this year, his math showed that nine million electric cars have the same carbon footprint as 27 million hybrids. His analysis accounted for emissions from battery and vehicle production. As you can imagine, stating that an EV pollutes as much as three hybrids has sparked significant controversy.\n\nAs a refresher, car companies active in the 27 member states of the European Union must now slash CO emissions by 90 percent compared to 2021 levels. The EC makes it clear that internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, range extenders, and mild hybrids will continue even after 2035. The remaining 10 percent of emissions must be offset by biofuels and synthetic fuels, as well as by low-carbon steel produced in the EU.\n\nAll told, there is no end date for combustion engines in the EU.",

      "body": "Legacy carmakers like Ford are realising they need to provide electric vehicles that meet local needs.\n\nThe unravelling of the transition to electric cars in the US and Europe has handed Chinese automakers an opportunity to cement their dominance in the electrification race, according to analysts.\n\nIn two blows to the outlook for electric vehicles (EVs), the European Commission on Dec 16 effectively\n\nabandoned its ban on combustion engine vehicles by 2035\n\n.\n\nA day earlier, on Dec 15, Ford Motor announced it would take US$19.5 billion (S$25.2 billion) in charges tied to a retreat from its electric strategy.\n\nThat creates a gap that Chinese carmakers, who have strengthened their position as the leading producers of EVs over the past decade, can fill, with companies like BYD and Xiaomi making rapid advances with in-cabin technology, advanced driver assistance systems and ultra-fast charging.\n\nIn contrast, Ford is scrapping plans for electric F-Series trucks and will shift production toward gas and hybrid vehicles.\n\n\"It's really sinking in that the US or EU can't catch up,\" said Mr Daniel Kollar, head of Automotive and Mobility Practice at consultancy Intralink Group.\n\nLegacy carmakers like Ford are realising they need to provide EVs that meet local needs, Mr Kollar said. With a range of just 386km, the electric F-150 could not haul heavy things as far as the petrol version of the workhorse.\n\nThey need to find a strategy where they can still leverage their combustion know-how, such as with plug-in hybrids or extended-range EVs, and fend off competition from Chinese carmakers who are miles ahead when it comes to pure-battery EVs, Mr Kollar added.\n\nWhile the gloss has come off the EV market, BloombergNEF still forecasts that global sales of electric cars will increase 16 per cent in 2026 to 25.4 million units.\n\nEurope is a key market for Chinese EV brands in search of growth and higher margins to offset a slowdown and long-running price war at home.\n\nWhile the backing away from the combustion engine ban and a scaling back of incentives supporting EVs in the region could dent demand, Chinese cars still have room to compete, according to Mr Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight.\n\n\"It won't have a direct impact,\" Mr Zhang said.\n\nEven with Europe's tariffs, Chinese carmakers \"have enough edge to compete\", he added.\n\nOne of the main sticking points for drivers looking to make the switch to an electric car is price, an area where Chinese manufacturers have an advantage.\n\nBYD earlier in 2025 launched the Dolphin Surf in Europe, a fully electric hatchback that sells for less than \u20ac23,000 (S$34,800).\n\nThe European Commission's retreat from banning exhaust pipe emissions by 2035 shows a lack of will to do the \"correct but difficult thing\", Mr Zhang said.\n\nWhile it seems to be a positive move for European manufacturers, it will \"inevitably lead to laziness and complacency\".\n\nIn December, Volkswagen will end output of electric ID.3 hatchbacks in Dresden, the first time in 88 years the carmaker will have ceased production at a German assembly plant.\n\nTo be sure, Chinese EV makers are also facing their own challenges such as slowing demand at home, intensifying competition and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBYD's total sales have fallen for three consecutive months\n\n, and the company is still producing one plug-in hybrid with a gas engine under the hood for every battery-only EV.\n\nChinese authorities are also reining in unreasonable price cuts and asking carmakers to pay their suppliers faster, which could impact sales and cash flow.\n\nAnd while Chinese EVs have effectively been locked out of the US by punitive tariffs, they are making steady inroads in markets from South America to the Middle East and South-east Asia.\n\nA lack of competitive models from European and US automakers risks ceding those markets to China as well.

      "title": "When the plug gets pulled: Policy, demand drag EVs",
      "body": "Electric vehicles face growing uncertainty as regulatory shifts and slowing demand test global strategies. Automakers are now stretching timelines and leaning towards hybrids, reflecting a more pragmatic and uneven path forward for electrification, driven by consumer economics and evolving political priorities.\n\nAs the global auto industry approaches 2026, electric vehicles, once positioned as the uncontested future of mobility, are facing uncertainty. Regulatory policy shifts and slowing demand in key markets are converging to test the resilience of EV strategies worldwide. While electrification remains important everywhere, the pace, shape and profitability of the transition are uncertain across regions. From policy rollbacks in Europe and the United States to subsidy fatigue in China and affordability challenges in India, EVs are increasingly caught between political priorities and consumer economics.\n\nAlso Read: EU eases landmark ban on new petrol and diesel cars to boost auto industry\n\nThe early 2020s marked an era of exuberant EV investment, driven by aggressive climate targets, generous subsidies and optimistic demand forecasts. Automakers committed hundreds of billions of dollars. But by late 2025, the momentum seems to be slowing. Governments are reassessing green policies amid industrial pressure and voter concerns, while consumers, who face cost-of-living pressures, are becoming more cautious about big-ticket EV purchases.\n\nThe result is not rejection of electrification but a shift. Carmakers are stretching timelines, scaling back pure battery-electric offerings and leaning more heavily on hybrids, plug-in hybrids and range-extended electric vehicles. These technologies offer emissions reductions without fully abandoning combustion engines, aligning better with shifting policies and uneven demand.\n\nEurope's EV push has long been anchored in regulation, particularly the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. That clarity gave automakers a clear deadline around which to plan investments. The European Commission's latest proposal to soften this ban is a turning point.\n\nThe European Commission unveiled a plan on Tuesday to drop the EU's effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035 after pressure from the region's auto sector, marking the bloc's biggest retreat from its green policies in recent years. The move, which still needs approval from EU governments and the European Parliament, would allow continued sales of some non-electric vehicles. Carmakers in regional industrial powerhouse Germany and in Italy had sought easing of the rules. The EU executive appears to have bowed to calls from carmakers to keep selling plug-in hybrids and range extenders that burn fuel as they struggle to compete against Tesla and Chinese electric vehicle makers. Under Tuesday's proposal, EU targets would shift to a 90% cut in CO2 emissions from 2021 levels, instead of current rules that all new cars and vans from 2035 have zero emissions. By allowing some non-electric vehicles beyond 2035 and shifting targets to a 90% CO\u2082 reduction rather than zero emissions, Brussels has signaled a willingness to compromise.\n\nThis retreat reflects mounting pressure from Europe's auto industry, especially in Germany and Italy, where manufacturers are struggling to compete with Tesla and fast-moving Chinese EV makers. High production costs, slower-than-expected consumer uptake and intensifying global competition have weakened the business case for an all-in battery-electric strategy. Allowing plug-in hybrids and range extenders offers automakers breathing room, enabling them to meet emissions goals while preserving margins and manufacturing flexibility.\n\nFor EVs, however, the policy shift introduces uncertainty. The dilution of long-term mandates risks slowing infrastructure investment and dampening consumer confidence, especially in markets where EV adoption still depends heavily on regulatory support rather than pure cost competitiveness.\n\nIn the U.S., EVs are facing a sharper and more abrupt reversal. The Trump administration's rollback of federal support has fundamentally altered the economics of electric cars. The expiration of the long-standing $7,500 consumer tax credit and the easing of tailpipe emissions rules have removed key demand drivers almost overnight. The freeze on fuel-economy fines has further reduced regulatory pressure on automakers to prioritize EVs.\n\nThe impact on sales has been dramatic, with U.S. EV volumes dropping sharply toward the end of 2025. Automakers that ramped up production in anticipation of sustained growth are now competing for a shrinking pool of buyers.\n\nAlso Read: Ford retreats from EVs, takes $19.5 billion charge as Trump policies grip industry\n\nThe EU move follows on the heels of U.S. carmaker Ford Motor announcing on Monday a $19.5 billion writedown as it axes several EV models. It is the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry's retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration's policies and weakening EV demand. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will replace the fully electric F-150 Lightning with a new extended-range electric model that uses a gas-powered engine to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.\n\nFord's shift reflects the auto industry's response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook for electrics dimmed significantly this year as Trump's policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars. U.S. sales of electric vehicles fell about 40% in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand.\n\nThe Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations. The recent dropoff in U.S. EV sales leaves automakers that hurried electric models to market competing over a shrinking pool of buyers. Like Ford, many traditional automakers are rotating back to gas and hybrid models, while narrowing their EV offerings to shore up losses in that space.\n\nGeneral Motors took a $1.6 billion charge in October as it adjusted its EV factory plans, and warned that it would likely take more charges in the future. Stellantis has also backtracked on some of its EV plans, axing a scheduled electric Ram pickup truck and leaning into hybrids. Some traditional automakers' move to hybrids follows the lead of Toyota Motor, the longtime market leader on hybrid models, which emphasized the technology even during the industry's EV euphoria.\n\nChina remains the world's largest EV market, but it too is entering a more challenging phase. Years of generous subsidies, tax exemptions and industrial policy support created explosive growth, but also intense competition and overcapacity. As Beijing gradually withdraws financial incentives, the market is showing signs of strain.\n\nThe expected reduction in trade-in subsidies and the reintroduction of purchase taxes for EVs from January 2026 are likely to cool demand after a year-end surge. Forecasts already point to a rare decline in EV sales next year, marking a turning point after half a decade of uninterrupted growth. Consumers rushing to buy before incentives expire may leave a demand vacuum in early 2026.\n\nMainland China EV sales are likely to drop in 2026, the first decline since 2020, if Beijing stops granting cash subsidies and tax incentives to buyers, according to a JPMorgan Chase forecast. Given a likely surge in EV sales before the end of 2025 and lower government support for EVs, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) will cut its full-year forecasts for 2026 and 2027 to 14% and 3%, respectively, from previously expected levels of 16% and 5%. Based on these revisions, the five-year compound annual growth rate for EV sales in China will fall from 12% to 8%.\n\nThe government's clampdown on aggressive discounting highlights deeper structural problems. Price wars driven by weak demand and excess capacity have eroded profitability across the sector. While new rules aim to curb below-cost pricing, they do little to address the underlying imbalance between supply and demand. For many Chinese EV makers, especially smaller players, the next phase will be about survival rather than expansion.\n\nIndia stands out as a relative bright spot, with EV registrations continuing to rise and surpassing previous annual records in 2025. Yet beneath the headline growth, penetration remains low and highly sensitive to pricing. The Indian EV market is still largely dependent on policy support and a favorable cost comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles.\n\nThat balance has been disrupted by the September GST cut on petrol and diesel cars. By lowering ICE vehicle prices, the government inadvertently widened the affordability gap with EVs, undermining the total cost of ownership argument that had driven much of the recent adoption. In a price-sensitive market like India, even small shifts in upfront cost can significantly affect consumer behaviour.\n\nThe response from automakers, which are now offering deep discounts on EV models, highlights the fragility of demand. While long-term prospects remain strong given urban pollution concerns and energy security goals as well as affordability, India's EV transition is proving vulnerable to short-term policy changes and competitive pricing dynamics.\n\nAcross key markets in the world, a common pattern is emerging. EVs are no longer advancing on a straight, policy-driven trajectory. Instead, the transition is becoming slower, more uneven and more closely tied to economic realities. Governments are rethinking support, automakers are hedging bets with hybrids and range extenders, and consumers are weighing costs more carefully in an uncertain global economy.\n\nElectric vehicles remain central to the future of the automotive industry, but the events of 2025 show that the path forward will be more pragmatic and uneven. Success in the next phase will depend less on bold targets and policy support, and more on affordability, infrastructure, supply-chain resilience and technologies that bridge the gap between combustion engines and full electrification.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)",

      "body": "Chief reporter at the Global Times covering China's macroeconomy, China-US relations, high-tech industries. Lead reports on the Belt and Road ...\n\nWorkers complete assembling an electric vehicle (EV) at China's EV start-up Leapmotor in Jinhua, East China's Zhejiang Province on April 1, 2024. The smart EV factory delivered 14,567 new vehicles in March, a yearly increase of 136 percent. Photo: VCG\n\nThe European Commission unveiled a planon Tuesday to drop the EU's effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035 after pressure from the region's auto sector, \"marking the bloc's biggest retreat from its green policies in recent years,\" the Reuters reported.\n\nWhile the move may stem from multiple pragmatic factors, it underscores the bloc's deep-seated anxiety over the waning competitiveness of European local carmakers amid fierce global rivalry in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, in particular from Chinese and US peers. This unease is particularly heightened by the fact that, despite the EU's imposition of tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, the resulting higher prices have failed to curb the growing popularity of Chinese cars, analysts said, warning that recent developments indicate the tariff policy may be producing the opposite of its intended effect.\n\nThe move, which still needs approval from EU governments and the European Parliament, would allow continued sales of some non-electric vehicles, the Reuters reported. The EU executive \"appears to have bowed to calls from carmakers to keep selling plug-in hybrids and range extenders that burn fuel as they struggle to compete against Teslaand Chinese EV makers,\" according to the report.\n\nFeng Shiming, a car analyst from Menutor Consulting,told the Global Times on Wednesday that the EU has been sitting unease,watching its traditional industry of auto manufacturing at risk of lagging behind the US and China. The European EV brands' waning competitiveness is because that \"the core technologies of pure electric vehicles are not in the hands of Europeans.\"\n\n\"In the 'three electric systems' (battery, motor and electronic control), Chinese companies hold a clear advantage in batteries and motors, while electronic control is dominated by Tesla in the US and other US tech giants. In terms of intelligence, China and the US are also far ahead of European carmakers,\" Feng explained.\n\nObservers doubt whether the new plan that shakes the principle of \"environmental protection\"would help European automakers to reverse its sliding EV trend.\n\nUnder the proposal, EU targets would shift to a 90 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions from 2021 levels, instead of current rules that all new cars and vans from 2035 have zero emissions, the Reuters report noted.\n\nMeanwhile, the policy won't have much impact on Chinese EVs' sales in Europe, and it may fuel the Chinese exports of plug-in hybrid models, which Chinese carmakers also have demonstrated a clear advantage, analysts said.\n\n\"In the medium- to long-term, whoever masters the core technologies and development direction of EV while maintaining low costs will win the market. In these aspects, Chinese carmakers are expected to retain considerable advantages in the foreseeable future,\" Feng said. He noted that Chinese carmakers also possess ample technological reserves and industrial support across horizontal technology routes, vertical industry chains, and even paths toward intelligence.\n\nIn October 2024, the EU decided to impose definitive countervailing duties on Chinese-made EVs for a period of five years. Analysts suggest the bloc to abolish the tariff policy, which is functioning in the opposite way, and resort to a cooperative approachwith China instead.\n\nDespite the protectionism move, China's EV market share hasmore than trebled in Europeto around 7 percent in the first half of 2025 compared with about 2 percent in 2022, Forbes reported, citing data from BMI, a Fitch Solutions company.\n\nThe Forbes report also cited a report by Schmidt Automotive Research as saying that Western Europe market share for Chinese EVs will jump to 11 percent this year or 269,450 vehicles, up from 9.6 percent in 2024, and compared with only 3.8 percent in 2021.\n\n\"Even after factoring in the higher tariffs, the steep cost advantage of Chinese EVs ensures they still have considerable pricing headroom in Europe. This stems from inherent disparities in raw material costs, production methods, and labor expenses,\" Feng said.",

      "body": "The European Union has relaxed regulations regarding its intended complete banning on combustion engine vehicle sales by 2035.\n\nThe European Union has revised its total banning of combustion engine vehicle sales by 2035. Image: iStock The EU on Tuesday walked back a 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars seen as a milestone in the fight against climate change, as the bloc pivots to bolstering its crisis-hit auto sector.\n\nUnder proposals slammed by green groups as an act of \"self-sabotage\", carmakers will have to cut exhaust emissions from new vehicles by 90 percent from 2021 levels -- down from an envisaged 100 percent. This means that in practice automakers will still be able to sell a limited number of polluting vehicles -- from plug-in hybrids to diesel cars -- beyond 2035, provided the resulting emissions are \"compensated\" in various ways. The EU's industry chief, Stephane Sejourne, insisted the bloc's green ambitions stood intact as he put forward a plan billed as a \"lifeline\" for Europe's auto industry. \"The European Commission has chosen an approach that is both pragmatic and consistent with its climate objectives,\" he told AFP.The combustion-engine ban was hailed as a major win in the climate fight and a key tool to drive investments in electrification when adopted in 2023. But carmakers and their backers have lobbied hard over the past year for Brussels to relax it, in the face of fierce competition from China and a slower-than-expected shift to electric vehicles . Europe's biggest automaker Volkswagen welcomed the move as \"pragmatic\" and \"economically sound\", while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said allowing for \"more openness to technology and greater flexibility\" was the right step.- 'Self-sabotage' - Weakening the ban is the most striking result yet of a pro-business push that has seen the EU pare back a slew of environmental laws this year -- on the grounds they risk weighing on growth.\"This backward industrial policy is bad news for jobs, air quality, the climate, and would slow down the supply of affordable electric cars,\" said Greenpeace Germany's executive director, Martin Kaiser. Post 2035, carmakers will have to compensate for planet-warning emissions spewed by combustion-engine vehicles through credits generated by the use of made-in-Europe, low-carbon steel and e-fuels and biofuels put on the market by energy firms. Beset by announcements of job cuts and factory closures over the past year, Europe's auto industry -- which employs almost 14 million people and accounts for about seven percent of Europe's GDP -- had maintained that the 2035 goal was no longer realistic. High upfront costs and the lack of adequate charging infrastructure in parts of the 27-nation union mean consumers have been slow to warm to EVs, producers say. Just over 16 percent of new vehicles sold in the first nine months of 2025 run on batteries, according to industry figures. Critics, including Spain, France and the Nordic countries, had warned that ditching the ban risked slowing the shift to electric, deterring investments. While the French presidency called the EU's auto plan \"balanced\" overall, the country's environment minister slammed the \"flexibility\" granted for petrol and diesel cars, and said Paris hoped to stop it from becoming law. \"Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs while China races further ahead,\" said William Todts, director of the clean-transport advocacy group T&E. \"Weakening the CO2 standards for cars is an act of self-sabotage,\" added Linda Kalcher of Strategic Perspectives, a think tank.The commission also unveiled a slew of additional measures to support the auto sector as part of a package that needs approval from the EU parliament and member states. In the run-up to 2035, carmakers will benefit from \"super credits\" for small \"affordable\" electric cars made in the EU, in an accounting trick that would make reaching emission targets easier. Brussels also proposed reducing the interim 2030 emission target for vans from 50 to 40 percent and allowing truck manufacturers more time to meet their own 2030 target, in line with a previous concession to automakers. To boost EV sales, medium and large firms will be required to green their fleets, which currently account for about 60 percent of new car sales in Europe. And the EU will provide 1.5 billion euros to support European battery producers through interest-free loans. Road transport accounts for about 20 percent of total planet-warming emissions in Europe, and 61 percent of those come from cars' exhaust pipes, according to the EU.\n\nSimilar News:You can also read news stories similar to this one that we have collected from other news sources.\n\nAfrican players in Europe: Salah off to AFCON amid uncertaintySalah came off the bench midway through the first half and set up the second goal in a 2-0 Premier League win over Brighton at the weekend.\n\nRead more \"\n\nAfDB Unveils Strategic Roadmap to Unlock Africa's AI Potential, Targeting $1 Trillion GDP Boost by 2035The African Development Bank releases a comprehensive report outlining a strategic roadmap for leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive economic growth and social transformation across Africa.

Under Tuesday's proposal, the target would shift to a 90 per cent cut in CO2 emissions from 2021 levels, instead of 100 per cent.\n\nThe European Commission proposed on Tuesday dropping the EU's effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035 by allowing continued sales of some non-electric vehicles following intense pressure from Germany, Italy and Europe's auto sector.\n\nThe EU executive appears to have bowed to calls from carmakers to keep selling plug-in hybrids and range extenders that burn fuel as they struggle to compete against Tesla and Chinese electric vehicle makers.\n\nCurrent EU rules require all new cars and vans from 2035 to have zero emissions. Under Tuesday's proposal, the target would shift to a 90 per cent cut in CO2 emissions from 2021 levels, instead of 100 per cent.\n\nAutomakers would need to offset the remaining emissions by using lower-carbon steel made in the EU and synthetic e-fuels or non-food biofuels such as agricultural waste and used cooking oil.\n\nThe plan also gives automakers a three-year window from 2030 to 2032 to cut car CO2 emissions by 55 per cent from 2021 levels, while the 2030 target for vans would be eased to 40 per cent from 50 per cent.\n\nThe moves, which require approval from EU governments and the European Parliament, mark the bloc's biggest retreat from its green policies enacted over the previous five years. It follows Ford Motor announcing on Monday a $19.5 billion writedown as it axes several EV models, in response to the Trump administration's policies and weakening EV demand. European carmakers including Volkswagen and Fiat owner Stellantis have also flagged soft EV demand and urged looser targets and lower fines for missing them. Automotive lobby ACEA called the moment \"high noon\" for the sector.\n\nGerman manufacturers are under particular strain as they lose ground in China to local rivals and face growing competition at home from Chinese EV imports.\n\nEU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs have offered only limited relief.\n\nThe EV industry warned that easing emissions targets could undermine investment and leave Europe falling further behind China in the shift to cleaner driving.\n\n\"Moving from a clear 100 per cent zero-emissions target to 90 per cent may seem small, but if we backtrack now, we won't just hurt the climate. We'll hurt Europe's ability to compete,\" said Michael Lohscheller, CEO of Swedish EV manufacturer Polestar.\n\nWilliam Todts, executive director of clean transport advocacy group T&E, said the EU was playing for time while China was racing ahead.\n\n\"Clinging to combustion engines won't make European automakers great again,\" he said. The Commission also outlined plans to boost EV uptake in corporate fleets, which account for about 60 per cent of new car sales in Europe. National targets for 2030 and 2035 would be set based on GDP per capita, leaving countries to decide how to meet them. Industry groups have cited Belgium's tax breaks for EV company cars as a model. The Commission further proposed creating a new regulatory category for small EVs, subject to lighter rules and eligible for extra credits towards CO2 targets if made in the EU.>",

      "body": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz Tuesday hailed the EU's proposals to help the struggling auto sector and manufacturers gave them a cautious welcome -- but an industry group slammed the measures as \"disastrous\".\n\nThe German leader and the country's ailing auto sector had been pushing for a 2035 ban on new diesel and petrol cars to be eased, arguing demand for electric vehicles in Europe remains weak and they need more time to catch up with Chinese EV makers.\n\nThe EU heeded the calls, and under its proposals carmakers will have to cut exhaust emissions from new vehicles by 90 percent from 2021 levels -- down from an envisaged 100 percent -- with the remainder \"compensated\" in various ways.\n\n\"More openness to technology and greater flexibility are the right steps,\" said Merz, who has made vocal demands for the ban to be eased as the country's flagship auto sector faces mounting problems.\n\n\"It's good that...the (European) Commission is now opening up regulation in the automotive sector,\" he said in a statement, adding that his government would now \"examine the Commission's extensive proposals in detail\".\n\nVolkswagen -- the biggest automaker in Europe -- welcomed the EU's \"pragmatic\" proposals, calling them \"economically sound\".\n\n\"Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions,\" said the carmaker, which has been cutting thousands of jobs amid the choppy transition to EVs, sagging demand and fierce competition in key market China.\n\nPremium automaker BMW said it was an \"important step\" that the bloc was \"recognising the future viability of the combustion engine\".\n\nHowever top Germany auto industry group the VDA was scathing in its criticism, slamming what it said were ill-conceived measures.\n\nWhile the EU had recognised that remaining open to different technologies was important, its proposal was \"fraught with so many obstacles it threatens to remain ineffective in practice,\" VDA President Hildegard Mueller told a press conference.\n\n\"In times of increasing international competition, in times when European economic power is crucial, this overall package from Brussels is disastrous,\" she said.\n\nShe criticised Brussels for seeking to impose \"new requirements\" on the struggling sector in areas such as green steel and renewable fuels.\n\nEnvironmental groups were also dismayed with the decision to water down a policy that had been hailed as a major win in the climate fight when adopted in 2023.\n\nNGO Environmental Action Germany said the proposals, which still need approval from the EU parliament and member states, were \"a capitulation to German combustion-engine companies that are ignorant of climate issues\".",

Stay up to date with all of the breaking sport, politics, entertainment, finance, weather and business headlines. Today's news, live updates & all the latest breaking stories from 7NEWS.\n\nEurope's controversial 2035 emissions laws will be wound back to allow the sale of a limited number of hybrid vehicles using internal combustion engines under a new proposal tabled in the European Parliament.\n\nReports earlier this month speculating on a proposed move have been proved correct after the European Commission officially announced plans to make the changes to the laws, following pressure from automakers. The previous emissions regulations would have effectively banned the sale of new vehicles with internal combustion engines by mandating that all new light vehicles sold could not \"emit any carbon-dioxide emissions\". While having no impact on vehicles already on the road, financial penalties would be paid by any automaker that exceeded its fleet emissions target. CarExpert can save you thousands on a new car. Click here to get a great deal. The European Union said 2035 was chosen given the typical 15-year lifespan of a vehicle in Europe, helping the broader goal of the transport sector to become carbon-neutral by 2050. \"The fleet-wide CO2 emission target for 2035 will require a 90 per cent decrease in emissions , so in practice that will mean 90 per cent of vehicles will be electric, abiding by the principle of technological neutrality,\" reads the proposal from the European Commission. Emissions from the portion of ICE-powered vehicles - be they petrol, diesel, hybrid or plug-in hybrid - would be offset by other measures, such as the use of synthetic and low-emission fuel as well as 'green steel' production. The plans also include incentivising small battery-electric vehicles produced in the EU with 'super credits', in a bid to stave off an influx of competition from China. As reported by Automotive News, the Commission will present the changes to the European Parliament in 2026. \"We hope an agreement can be struck as quickly as possible to guarantee stability,\" Commission Executive Vice President St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said. Many automakers had pushed for a change to the proposed regulations, citing slower-than-anticipated uptake of electric vehicles and a lack of charging infrastructure as key factors. That's despite EVs taking a 16.4 per cent share of new European vehicle sales to the end of October 2025 - double the 8.2 per cent share in Australia to November 30, and more than the 5.3 per cent share of US sales in November predicted by S&P Global. While EV sales are increasing, sales momentum and growth remain with hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, making up 34.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent, respectively, of all new vehicle sales in the EU to the end of October. As reported by theBBC, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association had warned the 100 per cent target would have cost the auto industry \"multi-billion\" penalties. Earlier this month, Ford called for the 2035 target to include hybrid models after suffering significant losses on EVs. Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller has slammed the changes to emissions regulations, arguing Europe \"doesn't have a demand problem, it has a confidence problem\". \"A fossil fuel car built in 2035 could still be polluting twenty years later. Moving from a clear 100 per cent zero-emissions target to 90 per cent may seem small, but if we backtrack now, we won't just hurt the climate, we'll hurt Europe's ability to compete,\" he said in a statement. \"Electrification will create long-term prosperity and jobs for the decades to come. Reversing course would do the opposite: extending the life of outdated industries for a few short years while the rest of the world moves ahead.\" However, larger brands including Volkswagen have responded positively to the changes. \"The European Commission's pragmatic draft proposal for new CO2 targets is economically sound overall,\" a statement from Volkswagen said, as reported by the BBC. \"The fact that small electric vehicles are to receive special support in future is very positive... Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions.\" Others, including Stellantis - which operates more than a dozen auto brands including Jeep, Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and Fiat - said the changes fall short. \"The proposals do not meaningfully address the issues that the industry is facing right now,\" the company said, according to Reuters. \"Specifically, the package fails to provide a viable trajectory for the light commercial vehicles segment, which is in a critical situation, and the 2030 flexibilities requested by the industry for passenger cars.\" Those 2030 changes include averaging emission targets for each automaker over a three-year period and covering passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Stellantis chairman John Elkann said in November that light commercial vehicles should have their own emission targets separate from passenger vehicles. A similar argument was made successfully by automakers in Australia with the introduction of the New Vehicle Emissions Standard . The NVES, which came into effect on January 1, 2025, sets carbon-dioxide emissions limits for passenger cars such as the Toyota Yaris, with a different measure for light commercial models such as the Ford Ranger. While a 2035 zero-emission law is in place for the ACT, it's the only jurisdiction in the country to have such regulations legislated so far and the Australian Government hasn't set any such target.

      "body": "The European Commission has proposed a new Automotive Package that would allow limited flexibility in the European Union's CO\u2082 emissions targets for cars and vans, marking what industry groups describe as a first step toward recalibrating the bloc's vehicle climate rules.\n\nThe package would give carmakers additional compliance options within the existing regulatory framework, without altering the EU's long-term climate targets. The commission said the measures are intended to reflect current market realities while preserving regulatory certainty for manufacturers and investors.\n\nThe package was unveiled on 16 December 2025 and is intended to provide more flexibility and technology-neutral approaches to meeting climate targets. Full details of the initiative are available on the European Commission's website.\n\nUnder the proposal, automakers would be able to make greater use of flexibility mechanisms to manage compliance costs during the transition to zero-emission vehicles. The commission framed the initiative as a targeted adjustment rather than a rollback, stressing that the EU's 2035 target for zero-emission new cars remains unchanged.\n\nThe European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) welcomed the proposal but said further changes will be needed to address structural challenges facing the industry.\n\nACEA said the package acknowledges mounting pressure on Europe's automotive sector, which is grappling with slowing demand for battery-electric vehicles, rising production costs and intensifying global competition. However, the industry group cautioned that flexibility measures alone will not resolve what it described as a widening gap between regulatory ambition and market readiness.\n\nACEA has repeatedly called for a more holistic approach that aligns CO\u2082 targets with enabling conditions such as charging infrastructure, affordable energy prices and resilient supply chains. It said the Commission's proposal is a constructive signal but does not yet address these broader constraints.\n\nThe Automotive Package will now be reviewed by the European Parliament and EU member states. Any changes to the CO\u2082 framework would require legislative approval before taking effect.\n\nThe commission said it will continue discussions with industry stakeholders as the EU assesses how best to balance climate objectives with competitiveness and investment stability in one of Europe's largest manufacturing sectors.",

      "title": "It's official: Europe to scrap 2035 combustion engine ban",
      "body": "Europe's controversial 2035 emissions laws will be wound back to allow the sale of a limited number of hybrid vehicles using internal combustion engines under a new proposal tabled in the European Parliament.\n\nReports earlier this month speculating on a proposed move have been proved correct after the European Commission (EC) officially announced plans to make the changes to the laws, following pressure from automakers.\n\nThe previous emissions regulations would have effectively banned the sale of new vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) by mandating that all new light vehicles sold could not \"emit any carbon-dioxide [tailpipe] emissions\".\n\nWhile having no impact on vehicles already on the road, financial penalties would be paid by any automaker that exceeded its fleet emissions target.\n\nCarExpert can save you thousands on a new car. Click here to get a great deal.\n\nThe European Union said 2035 was chosen given the typical 15-year lifespan of a vehicle in Europe, helping the broader goal of the transport sector to become carbon-neutral by 2050.\n\n\"The fleet-wide CO2 emission target for 2035 will require a 90 per cent decrease in emissions [compared with 2021], so in practice that will mean 90 per cent of vehicles will be electric, abiding by the principle of technological neutrality,\" reads the proposal from the European Commission.\n\nEmissions from the portion of ICE-powered vehicles - be they petrol, diesel, hybrid or plug-in hybrid - would be offset by other measures, such as the use of synthetic and low-emission fuel as well as 'green steel' production.\n\nThe plans also include incentivising small battery-electric vehicles produced in the EU with 'super credits', in a bid to stave off an influx of competition from China.\n\nAs reported by Automotive News, the Commission will present the changes to the European Parliament in 2026.\n\n\"We hope an agreement can be struck as quickly as possible to guarantee stability,\" Commission Executive Vice President St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said.\n\nMany automakers had pushed for a change to the proposed regulations, citing slower-than-anticipated uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) and a lack of charging infrastructure as key factors.\n\nThat's despite EVs taking a 16.4 per cent share of new European vehicle sales to the end of October 2025 - double the 8.2 per cent share in Australia to November 30, and more than the 5.3 per cent share of US sales in November predicted by S&P Global.\n\nWhile EV sales are increasing, sales momentum and growth remain with hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, making up 34.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent, respectively, of all new vehicle sales in the EU to the end of October.\n\nAs reported by theBBC, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association had warned the 100 per cent target would have cost the auto industry \"multi-billion\" penalties.\n\nEarlier this month, Ford called for the 2035 target to include hybrid models after suffering significant losses on EVs.\n\nPolestar CEO Michael Lohscheller has slammed the changes to emissions regulations, arguing Europe \"doesn't have a demand problem, it has a confidence problem\".\n\n\"A fossil fuel car built in 2035 could still be polluting twenty years later. Moving from a clear 100 per cent zero-emissions target to 90 per cent may seem small, but if we backtrack now, we won't just hurt the climate, we'll hurt Europe's ability to compete,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Electrification will create long-term prosperity and jobs for the decades to come. Reversing course would do the opposite: extending the life of outdated industries for a few short years while the rest of the world moves ahead.\"\n\nHowever, larger brands including Volkswagen have responded positively to the changes.\n\n\"The European Commission's pragmatic draft proposal for new CO2 targets is economically sound overall,\" a statement from Volkswagen said, as reported by the BBC.\n\n\"The fact that small electric vehicles are to receive special support in future is very positive... Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions.\"\n\nOthers, including Stellantis - which operates more than a dozen auto brands including Jeep, Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and Fiat - said the changes fall short.\n\n\"The proposals do not meaningfully address the issues that the industry is facing right now,\" the company said, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Specifically, the package fails to provide a viable trajectory for the light commercial vehicles segment, which is in a critical situation, and the 2030 flexibilities requested by the industry for passenger cars.\"\n\nThose 2030 changes include averaging emission targets for each automaker over a three-year period and covering passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.\n\nStellantis chairman John Elkann said in November that light commercial vehicles should have their own emission targets separate from passenger vehicles.\n\nA similar argument was made successfully by automakers in Australia with the introduction of the New Vehicle Emissions Standard (NVES).\n\nThe NVES, which came into effect on January 1, 2025, sets carbon-dioxide emissions limits for passenger cars such as the Toyota Yaris, with a different measure for light commercial models such as the Ford Ranger.\n\nWhile a 2035 zero-emission law is in place for the ACT, it's the only jurisdiction in the country to have such regulations legislated so far and the Australian Government hasn't set any such target.",

      "body": "European carbon emissions policy is on course for a major reset after reports that the European Union's proposed ban on the sale of new combustion-engine cars from 2035 could be altered.\n\nIn March 2023, after much negotiation, a law was approved stating that, from 2035, all new cars and vans sold in the EU must be free of carbon dioxide, or CO2, emissions, but that now looks less set in stone.\n\nThe EU's executive body, the European Commission, was expected to announce a policy change on Tuesday, with far-reaching consequences.\n\nTwo of Europe's biggest car producers are Italy and Germany, and they currently face stiff competition when it comes to the clean energy transition and electric vehicles, or EVs.\n\nManfred Weber, president of the conservative-centrist European People's Party bloc in the European Parliament, told the German newspaper Bild the ban was now \"off the table\".\n\n\"All engines currently manufactured in Germany can therefore continue to be produced and sold,\" he added, calling the proposed ban \"a serious industrial policy mistake\".\n\nSuch a move would also please German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has long supported changing the proposed date. \"The reality is that there will still be millions of combustion engine-based cars around the world in 2035, 2040 and 2050,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the idea also faces significant opposition. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, one of Europe's most prominent clean energy advocates, said going into reverse would hamper attempts to establish a European EV sector that could hold its own in the global market, and also cost jobs.\n\n\"We therefore reject (the idea) that combustion vehicles or other technologies without proven viability could continue to be marketed beyond 2035,\" he wrote in a letter to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nMichael Lohscheller, CEO of EV company Polestar, which was founded in Sweden but is now partly Chinese-owned, also reacted with dismay. He said: \"The (EV) technology is ready, charging infrastructure is ready, and consumers are ready. So what are we waiting for?\"\n\nWilliam Todts, executive director of clean transport advocacy group T&E, warned that the Commission's softening of its stance \"might seem like a wise strategy at first glance ... the trouble is once corporate lobbies smell weakness, they keep coming back for more\".\n\nKey pillar\n\n\"Gutting the EU's car CO2 rules would not just remove a key pillar of the European Green Deal,\" he said: \"it would consign Europe's carmakers to the car museum as well.\"\n\nThe news comes in the same week that research was published in the journal Nature, showing that global warming, fueled by CO2 emissions, is contributing to the loss of around 1,000 glaciers each year, with significant environmental implications.\n\nEven if temperature rises are held back to no more than 1.5 C, the globally agreed target to avoid the worst impact of global warming, that figure is on course to double by 2041, and by the year 2100, just half of the glaciers on the planet would be left.\n\nGovernment action on climate change could determine whether the world loses 2,000 or 4,000 glaciers annually by the middle of the century, according to the research.",

      "body": "The European Commission said on Tuesday that it would ease the planned 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars by shifting to a target requiring carmakers to cut tailpipe emissions by 90 percent, reported Xinhua.\n\nThe remaining 10 percent would be offset by the use of low-carbon steel made in the European Union (EU), or from e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nUnder the Automotive Package proposed by the Commission, automakers could still sell some non-fully electric vehicles (EVs) after 2035, such as plug-in hybrids, range extenders, and mild hybrids, alongside fully electric and hydrogen models.\n\nThis would mark a shift from the EU rules adopted in 2023, which set a 100 percent carbon reduction target for new cars and vans from 2035. Germany and Italy have been among the leading opponents to the rules, stepping up pressure on the EU to relax them, citing that the bloc needs to bolster its industrial competitiveness.\n\n\"We've not abandoned any of our decarbonization goals, but we have shown pragmatism,\" European Commissioner for Industrial Strategy Stephane Sejourne told a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe Commission said carmakers will be able to benefit from \"super credits\" before 2035 for small, affordable EVs made in the EU. The move is aimed at accelerating the roll-out of more small EV models.\n\nRegarding the 2030 targets for cars and vans, the Commission introduced additional flexibility by allowing \"banking and borrowing\" over 2030-2032. It also proposed lowering the 2030 carbon reduction target for vans from 50 percent to 40 percent, citing structurally slower EV uptake in the segment.\n\nIn addition, the Commission announced lower carbon emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles to make it easier to meet the 2030 targets and said it will set member state-level targets for corporate fleets to accelerate the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles.\n\nAs part of a broader Automotive Package, the revision of carmakers' emission targets aims to shore up Europe's car industry as it navigates the transition to clean mobility.\n\nBeyond emission standards, the Commission also unveiled a 1.8-billion-euro \"Battery Booster\" plan to accelerate the development of an EU-based battery value chain, with 1.5 billion euros earmarked for interest-free loans to battery cell producers in Europe.\n\nThe package also includes measures to cut red tape and lower compliance costs for manufacturers, the Commission said.",

      "title": "Future of driving takes an unexpected turn, as gas cars get a new boost - The Boston Globe",
      "body": "Those retreats, taken together, show that the full-on electric transition is far less certain than it might have looked several years ago -- and that polluting cars and trucks could remain on roads across Europe and America for decades to come. The moves also sharpen the contrast between the West and China, which has developed a massive and lucrative EV market supplied by state-backed automakers.\n\nIn the United States, where President Trump has portrayed electric cars as an expensive \"scam,\" the White House has cut EV incentives and this month announced plans to weaken fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks.\n\nEuropean officials say they favor a future that is mostly electric, and many countries still have EV incentives in place. But Brussels faced intense pressure from the continent's automakers to dilute the 2035 ban. Those legacy carmakers, with huge workforces and factories built around combustion engines, have struggled to compete with China's low-cost, high-quality EVs.\n\nThe revised proposal will force carmakers to meet 90 percent fleetwide emissions reductions compared with 2021 levels. That means most vehicles will be fully electric. But it also leaves room for hybrids -- including those with a plug-in option -- and gas-powered vehicles.\n\n\"We're introducing some flexibilities for manufacturers,\" the EU's climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, said at a news conference.\n\nWhile there remain good reasons to revere the gas-powered car -- its history, its motor-revving power -- passenger cars and vans account for about 10 percent of the global carbon dioxide emissions. Cutting emissions in other sectors, such as shipping or aviation, require huge and technically difficult transformations. But with cars, the technology is already available.\n\nFerdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, the director of the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany, said he sees the world's auto industry splintering into three parts: one in the United States, fully supportive of gas cars; one in China, all in on EVs; and another in Europe, where policies are now muddled. He said Chinese automakers are likely to benefit most from that dynamic, because the Chinese market dwarfs those in the U.S. and Europe and looks to keep growing -- and electrifying.\n\nAmerican and European markets have had a hard time switching from gas-powered vehicles, because combustion engines have higher profit margins. But that strategy leaves them in a long-term bind.\n\n\"In the future, China will define the rules of the car industry,\" Dudenh\u00f6ffer said.\n\nWith a license to keep producing gas vehicles, he said, Western manufacturers \"earn some kind of short-term windfall. But in the long term, they lose a lot. The advantages of the Chinese carmakers will be larger and larger.\"\n\nFord, in its announcement, said it was seeking out \"higher-return opportunities\" by expanding gas and hybrid options. It said it would produce a gas-powered pickup truck at a Tennessee plant while putting a hold on production of its flagship EV, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nCarmakers such as Volvo and Porsche have also pulled back from more ambitious EV plans. Earlier this year, Stellantis, which includes the Jeep and Fiat brands, shifted away from plans to be fully electric in Europe by 2030.\n\nThe gas vehicle ban had been a cornerstone of Europe's much-heralded climate plan, introduced four years ago as officials cited the \"generational task\" of saving the planet. At the time, EU leaders said they had put the continent's car industry -- which accounts for 7 percent of Europe's gross domestic product -- at the forefront of innovation by creating a clear future target.\n\nOfficials also had reasoned that a 2035 ban would allow an additional 15 years to phase out older gas and diesel vehicles from the roads, in line with the EU's goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nBut large automakers, including Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and BMW, have seen their market value nose-dive. In a strategic error, the EVs they produced tended to be high-end, not for the mass market.\n\nWhen the European Parliament shifted rightward in elections last year, the momentum to water down the 2035 policy grew. In the meantime, leaders in Germany and Italy described the target as a danger to European jobs.\n\n\"Such a hard cutoff in 2035 will not take place, if I have anything to do with it,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had said.\n\nMatthias Schmidt, an auto industry analyst, said that high-end automakers like Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes had struggled to make the case for EVs.\n\n\"Their core customer base has been more interested in the mechanical prowess and the engineering of a sports car,\" Schmidt said. \"This gives them a license to continue going forward.\"\n\nEuropean carmakers are also now rolling out more affordable EV models. But the fastest-growing EV seller on the continent, though starting from a small scale, is a Chinese company, BYD, which saw sales skyrocket 300 percent in the first nine months this year, according to industry data. European automakers also rely on components made in China, given its dominance in batteries and in the crucial minerals that go into them.\n\nThe plan unveiled Tuesday by the European Commission stated that fleet emissions from 2035 onward would need to be \"compensated\" with other measures, such as the use of low-carbon steel made within the bloc. E-fuels or biofuels could also be used.\n\nThe proposal must still be discussed and approved by the European Parliament and by EU member states.\n\nSt\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, the EU's commissioner for industrial policy, said Europe was not abandoning its decarbonization plans.\n\n\"We're taking a pragmatic approach to the economic and geopolitical situation,\" he said.\n\nBut the European Green Party blasted the move to weaken the target and said it was undermining Europe's long-term climate goals.",

      "title": "EU Eases 2035 Car Rules, Allowing Petrol and Diesel Models to Stay on the Market - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency",
      "body": "The European Commission has proposed a significant change to its previously planned rules on new car sales, allowing vehicles with internal combustion engines to remain on the EU market beyond 2035. Under the revised approach, petrol and diesel cars, as well as hybrids, will still be permitted, provided manufacturers offset their remaining emissions through alternative measures such as the use of low-carbon steel produced in the EU and renewable fuels.\n\nUntil now, EU legislation required all new cars and vans sold after 2035 to be zero-emission, effectively limiting the market to electric vehicles only. Following sustained pressure from the automotive industry, particularly from Germany and Italy, the Commission has adjusted the target. Instead of a full elimination of emissions, carmakers will now be required to cut CO2 emissions from new vehicles by 90 percent compared to 2021 levels. According to the Commission, this shift does not weaken the EU's climate ambitions but reflects a more pragmatic path.\n\nEuropean Commission Vice-President St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said the overall objective remains unchanged, but flexibility is needed in light of consumer behavior and the challenges manufacturers face in scaling up fully electric production within the original timeframe. He stressed that any leeway granted to producers will be balanced by strict carbon compensation requirements.\n\nManufacturers that continue to sell vehicles with combustion engines will be required to offset the remaining emissions in advance through a dedicated credit system. These credits can be obtained by using low-carbon steel manufactured in Europe or by relying on renewable, synthetic fuels and biofuels. The Commission argues that this approach preserves the goal of achieving a fully decarbonised new car fleet by 2035, while allowing technological diversity in the transition period.\n\nThe new measures also include targeted support for the automotive sector. Brussels plans to provide \u20ac1.5 billion in interest-free loans to European battery producers, recognising their central role in the transition to cleaner mobility. In addition, the Commission intends to support the development of a new category of small electric vehicles, known as \"M1e\", designed to help European manufacturers compete with Chinese rivals.\n\nThese compact vehicles will be under 4.2 metres in length and will benefit from reduced regulatory burdens for a period of ten years. Cars of this type produced in Europe will generate so-called \"super credits\" for manufacturers, helping them meet their emissions targets. Member states will also be encouraged to introduce national incentives, such as purchase subsidies, to stimulate demand.\n\nThe revised plan places particular emphasis on professional vehicle fleets, which account for a substantial share of new car registrations in the EU. Decarbonisation targets for these fleets will be set at national level and will apply to large companies with more than 250 employees or annual turnover exceeding \u20ac50 million, including car rental firms. The aim is to boost demand for low-emission and fully electric vehicles where uptake can be more easily coordinated.\n\nSupport for European industry is another central element of the package. The Commission plans to promote \"Made in Europe\" production by introducing local content requirements for manufacturers receiving public funding. Emission credits linked to European low-carbon steel and battery support measures are part of this strategy. An additional policy document, referred to as an \"industrial accelerator\", is expected by the end of January and will outline further steps.\n\nThe Commission will also reassess electrification requirements for light and heavy goods vehicles. Truck manufacturers have warned that weak demand for electric models could expose them to heavy penalties from 2030 onwards, prompting Brussels to review the existing obligations.\n\nThe changes have been welcomed in Bulgaria. Svetoslav Benchev, chairman of the Bulgarian Oil and Gas Association, argued that no energy source disappears overnight and warned against abruptly phasing out petroleum products in transport. He said such an approach could have negative consequences, particularly given current technological and market realities.\n\nThe European automotive sector employs nearly 14 million people and has been under increasing pressure in recent years due to strong competition from China and trade tensions with the United States. Against this backdrop, the Commission insists that the revised rules are intended to protect both climate objectives and the long-term viability of one of Europe's most important industries.",

      "body": "\"The European Commission has chosen an approach that is both pragmatic and consistent with its climate objectives,\" he told AFP.\n\nThe combustion-engine ban was hailed as a major win in the climate fight and a key tool to drive investments in electrification when adopted in 2023.\n\nCarmakers and their backers have lobbied hard over the past year for Brussels to relax it, in the face of fierce competition from China and a slower-than-expected shift to electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nEurope's biggest automaker Volkswagen welcomed the move as \"pragmatic\" and \"economically sound\", while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said allowing for \"more openness to technology and greater flexibility\" was the right step.\n\nGermany's leading auto industry group VDA, however, called the proposals \"disastrous\".\n\nWeakening the ban is the most striking result yet of a pro-business push that has seen the EU pare back a slew of environmental laws this year - on the grounds they risk weighing on growth.\n\n\"This backward industrial policy is bad news for jobs, air quality, the climate, and would slow down the supply of affordable electric cars,\" said Greenpeace Germany's executive director, Martin Kaiser.\n\nPost 2035, carmakers will have to compensate for planet-warning emissions spewed by combustion-engine vehicles through credits generated by the use of made-in-Europe, low-carbon steel and e-fuels and biofuels put on the market by energy firms.\n\nBeset by announcements of job cuts and factory closures over the past year, Europe's auto industry - which employs almost 14 million people and accounts for about 7% of Europe's GDP - had maintained that the 2035 goal was no longer realistic.\n\nHigh upfront costs and the lack of adequate charging infrastructure in parts of the 27-nation union mean consumers have been slow to warm to EVs, producers say.\n\nJust over 16% of new vehicles sold in the first nine months of 2025 run on batteries, according to industry figures.\n\nCritics, including Spain, France and the Nordic countries, had warned that ditching the ban risked slowing the shift to electric, deterring investments.\n\nWhile the French presidency called the EU's auto plan \"balanced\" overall, the country's environment minister slammed the \"flexibility\" granted for petrol and diesel cars, and said Paris hoped to stop it from becoming law.\n\n\"Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs while China races further ahead,\" said William Todts, director of the clean-transport advocacy group T&E.\n\n\"Weakening the CO2 standards for cars is an act of self-sabotage,\" added Linda Kalcher of Strategic Perspectives, a think-tank.\n\nThe commission also unveiled a slew of additional measures to support the auto sector as part of a package that needs approval from the EU parliament and member states.\n\nIn the run-up to 2035, carmakers will benefit from \"super credits\" for small \"affordable\" electric cars made in the EU, in an accounting trick that would make reaching emission targets easier.\n\nBrussels also proposed reducing the interim 2030 emission target for vans from 50 to 40% and allowing truck manufacturers more time to meet their own 2030 target, in line with a previous concession to automakers.\n\nTo boost EV sales, medium and large firms will be required to green their fleets, which currently account for about 60% of new car sales in Europe.\n\nAnd the EU will provide \u20ac1.5 billion to support European battery producers through interest-free loans.\n\nRoad transport accounts for about 20% of total planet-warming emissions in Europe, and 61% of those come from cars' exhaust pipes, according to the EU.",

      "title": "EU scraps petrol car ban - what does it mean for UK's 2030 deadline?",
      "body": "The EU has backed away from its push to end petrol and diesel car sales by 2035, opting for more relaxed CO2 emissions-based targets instead of an electric-only mandate.\n\nIn a major climbdown, the European Commission confirmed car makers will no longer be forced to sell only zero-emissions vehicles, allowing some combustion-engine models to remain on sale beyond the deadline.\n\nManufacturers will instead be required to cut car exhaust emissions by 90 per cent - not 100 per cent - compared to 2021 levels in a shift designed to ease pressure on an industry struggling with weak EV demand and rising competition from China.\n\nThe reversal follows intense lobbying from German, Italian and European auto giants, who warn they are being undercut by cheaper Chinese imports.\n\nCritics say the move risks gutting one of the EU's flagship climate policies, while supporters argue it is a necessary concession to protect jobs and keep Europe's car industry alive.\n\nThe move heaps fresh pressure on the UK Government to reconsider its deadline to outlaw the sales of new petrol and diesel cars, which Labour accelerated to 2030 earlier this year.\n\nOpposition leader Kemi Badenoch has this week vowed the Conservatives would axe the 2030 ban, taxpayer-funded grants towards the purchase of EVs and binding zero emission vehicle sales targets.\n\nThe EU has backed away from its push to end petrol and diesel car sales by 2035, opting for looser emissions targets instead of a full electric-only mandate\n\nAnnouncing the watered-down proposal, Commission President von der Leyen said: 'Innovation. Clean mobility. Competitiveness. This year, these were top priorities in our intense dialogues with automotive sector, civil society organisations and stakeholders.\n\n'And today, we are addressing them all together.\n\n'As technology rapidly transforms mobility and geopolitics reshapes global competition, Europe remains at the forefront of the global clean transition.'\n\nPresident of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said 'Europe remains at the forefront of the global clean transition' after confirming plans to scrap the 2035 ban on petrol and diesel cars on Tuesday\n\nThe European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, Wopke Hoekstra added: 'We want our industries to be the leaders of the transition to a low-carbon economy because that is what is best for our climate, competitiveness and independence.\n\n'Today, we are stepping in to ensure a successful clean future for the automotive sector.\n\n'We are introducing flexibilities for manufacturers, and in turn this will have to be compensated with low-carbon steel and the use of sustainable fuels to drive down emissions.'\n\nCurrent EU rules require all new cars and vans from 2035 to have zero emissions.\n\nHowever, under Tuesday's proposal, the target would shift to a 90 per cent cut in CO2 emissions from 2021 levels, instead of 100 per cent.\n\nCar makers would need to offset the remaining 10 per cent CO2 emissions by using lower-carbon steel made in the EU and synthetic e-fuels or non-food biofuels such as agricultural waste and used cooking oil.\n\nThe plan also gives car makers a three-year window from 2030 to 2032 to cut car CO2 emissions by 55 per cent from 2021 levels, while the 2030 target for vans would be eased to 40 per cent from 50 per cent.\n\nThe moves, which require approval from EU governments and the European Parliament, mark the bloc's biggest retreat from its green policies enacted over the previous five years.\n\nEuropean car makers including Volkswagen and Fiat owner Stellantis have also flagged soft EV demand and urged looser targets and lower fines for missing them.\n\nAutomotive lobby ACEA called the moment 'high noon' for the sector.\n\nInstead of outlawing the sale of new petrol and diesels, those that cut CO2 emission by 90% compared to 2021 levels will be allowed to remain on sale beyond 2035. This will allow for car makers to experiment with the adoption of low CO2 synthetic e-fuels\n\nSynthetic fuel is manufactured using captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, together with hydrogen obtained from sustainable electricity sources such as wind, solar and nuclear power. When the fuel is burned, the aim is for it to release the same amount of carbon dioxide into the air that it has taken out during the manufacturing process, creating a carbon-neutral footprint\n\nPorsche is one of the car brands that has been pushing the development of e-fuels. It has invested over \u00a361million in a production plant in Chile, which is operated by HIF (pictured)\n\nGerman manufacturers are under particular strain as they lose ground in China to local rivals and face growing competition at home from Chinese EV imports.\n\nVolkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW are among the car giants to have lobbied for the relaxed rules, as have fellow European makers Renault and Stellantis.\n\nEU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs have offered only limited relief.\n\nLabour under pressure to delay 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars with EU primed to push back its deadline\n\nThe EV industry warned that easing emissions targets could undermine investment and leave Europe falling further behind China in the shift to cleaner driving.\n\n'Moving from a clear 100 per cent zero-emissions target to 90 per cent may seem small, but if we backtrack now, we won't just hurt the climate. We'll hurt Europe's ability to compete,' said Michael Lohscheller, CEO of Swedish EV manufacturer Polestar.\n\nWilliam Todts, executive director of green think tank Transport & Environment, said the EU was playing for time while China was racing ahead.\n\n'Clinging to combustion engines won't make European auto makers great again,' he said.\n\nThe Commission also outlined plans to boost EV uptake in corporate fleets, which account for about 60 per cent of new car sales in Europe.\n\nNational targets for 2030 and 2035 would be set based on GDP per capita, leaving countries to decide how to meet them.\n\nIndustry groups have cited Belgium's tax breaks for EV company cars as a model.\n\nThe Commission further proposed creating a new regulatory category for small EVs, subject to lighter rules and eligible for extra credits towards CO2 targets if made in the EU.\n\nThe UK Government intends to ban the sale of new traditional petrol and diesel cars in 2030, giving hybrids a five-year stay of execution until 2035. But pressure is mounting from Labour's opposition to following in the EU's tyre tracks and scrap the deadline entirely\n\nWhat does it mean for the UK's 2030 ban?\n\nDepartment for Transport officials are said to be standing firm and have told UK car manufacturers that Britain's 2030 deadline on the sales of conventional petrol and diesel models will not be adjusted.\n\nAccelerating the ban from 2035 was one of Labour's major manifesto pledges ahead of the previous general election, though having confirmed the renewed 2030 date earlier this year, it then relaxed the targets in April.\n\nThis included giving self-charging and plug-in hybrid vehicles - which use both a petrol engine and battery - a five-year stay of execution to remain in showrooms until 2035.\n\nA government spokesman earlier this week told the Daily Mail: 'We remain committed to phasing out all new non-zero emission car and van sales by 2035.\n\n'More drivers than ever are choosing electric, and November saw another month of increased sales with EV's accounting for one in four cars sold.'\n\nHowever, the Conservatives are ramping up the pressure.\n\nNice set of heels, Kemi! Badenoch tries out racing cars at Brands Hatch as she vows to scrap grants for electric cars to save \u00a33.8bn\n\nThis week, Kemi Badenoch confirmed the Tories would scrap the 2030 ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars if they win the next general election, saying Labour's push for EVs was an 'economic act of self-harm'.\n\nShe added that China would be 'the only winners' if Britain went electric, as she responded to reports that the EU was preparing to scrap its own deadline.\n\nShe said the European Union's 'change of heart' would mean Britain would be putting its domestic industry at 'a disadvantage' by going alone with the proposals.\n\nTo reverse the 2030 ban, Mrs Badenoch would also scrap the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which she dubbed a 'destructive' system - despite it being introduced by the Conversative Party almost two years ago.\n\nUnder the law, car manufacturers must meet rapidly increasing quotas for sales of electric vehicles (EVs), rising from 28 per cent in 2025 to 100 per cent a decade later.\n\nElectric future: The ZEV mandate forces car makers to sell an increasing volume of EVs between now and 2035. Failure to meet the annual targets can result in fines of \u00a312,000 per car under the required quota\n\nMrs Badenoch said: 'Labour's rush to Net Zero is having a disastrous effect on the UK car industry. The Conservatives will ensure that we protect the environment, but we will do so without forcing families to bear the brunt of the costs, and forcing car makers to meet deadlines that don't reflect consumer demand.\n\n'By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers.'\n\nAs well as ditching the 2030 ban, Badenoch also said she would slash subsidies for the electric sector to save the taxpayer \u00a33.8billion over the next decade. This includes almost \u00a32billion being invested in grants for purchasing EVs between now and 2030, along with funding for non-research and development programmes.\n\nResponding to today's announcement to the EU, Greenpeace UK's policy director Dr Douglas Parr said the UK 'must not join Europe in this act of economic self-sabotage'.\n\nHe added: 'Over just a few years, electric vehicles have grown to make up more than a quarter of new car sales globally, including the UK, and the trend is accelerating.\n\n'The Commission's proposal would generate short-term returns for the car industry, but no long-term future.\n\n'If the UK follows suit, it would be short-sighted in terms of industrial policy and job security for car workers, and negligent in terms of air quality and climate protection.'\n\nHe added: 'China's ability to run circles around the European car industry is the result of long-term strategic planning and investment.\n\n'Their EVs are not only cheaper to run, but in some cases already cheaper to buy than their fossil fuel equivalents, while we continue paying through the nose to breath exhaust fumes and destabilise our climate.\n\n'Britain needs to stop pandering to the slowest adopters, and learn from China's approach of setting and sticking to legal targets.'\n\nOn the same day the EU's plans to scrap the 2035 switch to EVs, production of the new electric Nissan Leaf started at the Sunderland factory in the North East. The future of the plant - and its 6,000-strong workforce - relies on the car being a volume seller\n\nOnly last month, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a pay-per-mile tax on electric cars from 2028 to cover the Exchequer's loss in traditional fuel duties as the car parc increasingly transitioned to EVs. However, the motor industry lambasted the policy as the 'wrong move at the wrong time' as private electric car demand is waning\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nPay-per-mile tax on EVs will trigger petrol car rationing and force prices higher, dealership boss warns\n\nThe announcement was made on the same day production of the new electric Nissan Leaf began at the Japanese car giant's Sunderland factory in the North East.\n\nWith Nissan posting a record net loss of \u00a33.8billion last year and introducing a cost-saving strategy, which includes shuttering seven vehicle plants worldwide, the Sunderland factory was spared to allow it to become the European production hub for the Leaf and another full-electric model.\n\nThe plant has received a \u00a3450million overhaul to retool for EV production, though the factory's future - and that of its 6,000 workforce - is now reliant on the Leaf selling strongly.\n\nLast month, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her Autumn Budget that electric car owners will be stung with a 3p-a-mile eVED tax from 2028 to cover a loss in traditional fuel duties resulting from the shift to electric vehicles.\n\nThe motor industry has widely lambasted the decision, calling it the 'wrong move at the wrong time', with registrations data showing muted demand for EVs from private buyers and a deceleration in battery car sales.\n\nSave on services and MOTs - and keep track of your car's documents\n\nThe This is Money Motoring Club is designed to make car ownership cheaper and simpler for This is Money and Daily Mail readers.\n\nPowered by MotorEasy it's the place to keep on top of tax, MOTs and servicing - and manage the important documents and receipts that boost your car's value.\n\nYou can also save money on maintenance and repairs - and book into one of 10,000 trusted workshops nationwide.\n\nNew members receive a \u00a320 reward voucher, which you can put towards repairs or even a warranty - giving you peace of mind that if something goes wrong, you won't be left footing the bill.\n\nYou can even get \u00a320 off an MOT with one of MotorEasy's listed providers.\n\n> Find out more about the This is Money Motoring Club",

      "body": "The EU on Tuesday walked back a 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars seen as a milestone in the fight against climate change, as the bloc pivots to bolstering its crisis-hit auto sector.\n\nThe EU's industry chief, St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, insisted the bloc's green ambitions stood intact as he put forward a plan billed as a \"lifeline\" for Europe's auto industry.\n\n\"The European Commission has chosen an approach that is both pragmatic and consistent with its climate objectives,\" he said.\n\nThe combustion-engine ban was hailed as a major win in climate fight when adopted in 2023.\n\nBut carmakers and their backers have lobbied hard over the past year for Brussels to relax it, in the face of fierce competition from China and a slower-than-expected shift to EVs.\n\nWeakening the ban is the most striking result yet of a pro-business push that has seen the EU pare back a slew of environmental laws this year - on the grounds they risk weighing on growth.\n\nIn practice, automakers will still be able to sell a limited number of polluting vehicles - from plug-in hybrids to diesel cars - past 2035.\n\nTo do so, they will have to compensate for the planet-warning emissions these cars spew into the atmosphere through two types of carbon credits.\n\nThe first will be generated by the use of made-in-Europe, low-carbon steel in car manufacturing.\n\nThe second will be outside carmakers' hands and tied to the amount of e-fuels and biofuels that energy companies put on the market every year.\n\nBeset by announcements of job cuts and factory closures over the past year, Europe's auto industry - which employs nearly 14 million people and accounts for about seven percent of Europe's GDP - had maintained that the 2035 goal was no longer realistic.\n\nHigh upfront costs and the lack of adequate charging infrastructure in parts of the 27-nation union mean consumers have been slow to warm to EVs, producers say.\n\nJust over 16 percent of new vehicles sold in the first nine months of 2025 run on batteries, according to industry figures.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday hailed the EU's weakening of its 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, saying that \"more openness to technology and greater flexibility are the right steps\".\n\n\"It's good that...the Commission is now opening up regulation in the automotive sector,\" Merz said in a statement, adding that his government would now \"examine the European Commission's extensive proposals in detail\".\n\nManfred Weber, the conservative head of the EU parliament's largest group, welcomed the new target, saying that \"forbidding technologies\" would be a gift to far-right populists.\n\nCritics, including Spain, France and the Nordic countries, had warned that ditching the ban risked slowing the shift to electric, undermining the EU's green agenda and deterring investments in electrification.\n\nFrance hit out Tuesday at the EU's decision to give carmakers flexibility on the sale of combustion-engine vehicles beyond 2035, saying it hoped to stop the proposal from becoming law.\n\n\"We regret the flexibility granted for combustion-engine cars,\" Environment Minister Monique Barbut said. \"We will do all we can to have this flexibility removed\" when the auto sector support package is put to EU member states for approval, she said.\n\nEnvironmental group Greenpeace also slammed the EU's \"U-turn\" on phasing out petrol and diesel cars, accusing the bloc of \"flogging a dead horse\" by diverting investments away from electric vehicles.\n\n\"This backward industrial policy is bad news for jobs, air quality, the climate, and would slow down the supply of affordable electric cars,\" said the group's Germany executive director, Martin Kaiser.\n\n\"To claim that tomorrow's jobs and innovations still lie in diesel or petrol engines, when the rest of the world has embarked on an industrial race towards batteries and electric vehicles, is to condemn the French and European automotive industry to decline,\" said Neil Makaroff, director at Strategic Perspectives, a think tank.\n\nThe commission also unveiled a slew of additional measures to support the auto sector as part of a package that needs approval from the EU parliament and member states.\n\nIn the run-up to 2035, carmakers will benefit from \"super credits\" for small \"affordable\" electric cars made in the EU, in an accounting trick that would make reaching emission targets easier.\n\nThis would mean that sales of electric cars under 4.2 metres in length will be counted 1.3 times, thus artificially boosting the share of zero-emission cars in an automaker's fleet.\n\nThe commission also proposed reducing the interim 2030 emission target for vans from 50 to 40 percent and allowing truck manufacturers more time to meet their own 2030 target, in line with a previous concession to automakers.\n\nTo boost EV sales, medium and large firms will be required to green their fleets, which currently account for about 60 percent of new car sales in Europe.\n\nAt least 30 percent of new vehicles bought by companies will need to be zero- or low-emission, under targets that will differ from country to country, with the bar set higher for richer nations.\n\nFinally, the EU will provide \u20ac1.5 billion to support European battery producers through interest-free loans.\n\nRoad transport accounts for about 20 percent of total planet-warming emissions in Europe, and 61 percent of those come from cars' exhaust pipes, according to the EU.",

      "body": "Dec. 16 (UPI) -- Officials in the European Union have revoked a planned ban on the production of vehicles with internal combustion engines and replaced it with a carbon dioxide emissions mandate.\n\nAutomakers in the European Union can continue producing so-called ICE vehicles, but only those that emit 90% fewer CO2 emissions by 2035, according to euro news.\n\nThe remaining 10% in emissions can be compensated for by using low-carbon steel made in the EU or by using alternative fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels.\n\n\"We're staying the course towards zero-emissions mobility, but introducing some flexibilities for manufacturers to meet their CO2 targets in the most cost-efficient way,\" Wopke Hoekstra, EU climate action commissioner, told media Monday.\n\nHoekstra called the change a \"win-win\" for consumers by offering them more choices for their personal transportation while continuing the EU's move to produce and sell more electric vehicles, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe EU will continue to promote the production and buying of electric vehicles via \"super credits,\" euro news reported.\n\nThe super credits enable automakers to accrue carbon credits for their respective manufacturing facilities in Europe.\n\n\"This will allow for plug-in hybrids, range extenders, mild hybrids and internal combustion engine vehicles to still.

      "body": "EU will allow ICE and hybrid cars beyond 2035 under new rules. Carmakers can offset emissions using fuels and green steel. No formal end date now exists for combustion car sales.\n\nEurope's big plan to end internal combustion by 2035 always seemed a bit like an immovable deadline carved into regulation. Now, that's over as the European Union is walking back that goal. The European Commission just unveiled a major revision to its automotive regulations, and it adds a lot more flexibility moving forward.\n\nRead: Looks Like Gas And Diesel Cars Won't Be Banned In Europe After All\n\nInstead of requiring a 100 percent reduction in tailpipe CO\u2082 emissions compared to 2021 levels, automakers will now need to achieve a 90 percent reduction from 2035 onward. That remaining 10 percent can be offset using a mix of biofuels, e-fuels, and credits tied to the use of low-carbon steel produced within the EU.\n\nThe full automotive regulation package, formally announced on December 16, will be presented to the European Parliament and Council in 2026 for formal review and approval.\n\nWhat Happens After 2035?\n\nIn practice, this opens the door for pure ICE cars, mild hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and range extenders to continue existing alongside EVs and hydrogen vehicles. Importantly, this revised proposal doesn't include a new sunset date for combustion engines.\n\nOnce the 90 percent target is met, there is no hard legal endpoint for selling ICE-powered vehicles, provided manufacturers can balance their emissions through the approved compensation mechanisms.\n\nAutomakers will also benefit from softened 2030 requirements, as emissions targets will now be averaged over the 2030 to 2032 period, offering manufacturers additional flexibility similar to the approach taken with 2025 targets.\n\nAgain, all of this is coming in the wake of pressure from industry leaders like BMW, VW, Mercedes, Renault, and Stellantis. Even Ford's CEO Jim Farley warned the EU that its previous targets were too stringent. It appears as if the corporate powers that be made their voices heard.\n\nPressure From the Top\n\nThe move follows a year of high-level meetings between EU officials and the auto industry, part of a broader \"strategic dialogue\" aiming to rebuild trust after years of tension, much of it stemming from the fallout of the VW diesel-emissions scandal.\n\nThat said, the EU is not abandoning electrification. The Commission is doubling down on incentives for small, affordable electric cars built in Europe, granting them \"super credits\" that count more heavily toward manufacturers' emissions compliance.\n\nA new M1E vehicle category will also simplify regulations for EVs under 4.2 meters (13.7 ft) in length, making it easier for governments to support them with targeted incentives.\n\nLightening the Load\n\nTo give automakers more stability, the Commission is also proposing a 10-year freeze on new vehicle regulations. That pause could significantly reduce compliance complexity and offer clearer long-term planning for product cycles.\n\nIn short, the EU isn't reversing course altogether, but it's trading the rigidity it once held for a bit more realism. Combustion engines won't die after 2035; they'll just be managed more heavily than in the past.",

      "title": "EU Caves Under Pressure From Automakers and Drops the 2035 Combustion Engine Ban",
      "body": "The European Commission greenlit a plan to scrap the ban on combustion engines after 2035 and instead set a 90% reduction target on CO2 emissions. The move, loudly advocated by certain European and American carmakers, has been harshly criticized by companies that invested in EV and battery manufacturing.\n\nThe European Union had one of the most ambitious plans to cut combustion engine pollution and switch entirely to electricity from 2035. However, as the deadline approached, carmakers fought vigorously to have these plans scrapped. After months of discussions that hinted at a softening of the emission mandate, the European Commission made the official announcement on Tuesday.\n\nUnder the revised plan, carmakers can continue to sell combustion vehicles after the 2035 deadline. Instead of an outright ICE ban, the auto industry must now ensure a 90% CO2 emission reduction compared to the 2021 levels. Carmakers will also have a three-year window from 2030 to 2032 to cut car emissions by 55% from 2021 levels. Meanwhile, the 2030 target for commercial vehicles was eased to 40% from 50%. Carmakers will still need to offset the remaining emissions by using lower-carbon steel made in the EU and synthetic e-fuels or biofuels.\n\nThe move will need approval from the governments and the European Parliament, but they are highly likely to pass in the current form. Some carmakers like Volkswagen in Germany and Fiat in Italy hailed the change as \"pragmatic\" and \"economically sound.\" At the same time, companies that invested billions in electrification called the decision \"a tragic win\" of legacy carmakers over electric cars.\n\nThe move appears to follow a softening of demand for EVs in the US, which led Ford to write off almost $20 billion it spent on its EV program. However, unlike the US, Europe recorded a healthy growth in EV sales, fueled by a flurry of affordable models from Renault, Stellantis, as well as Chinese carmakers like BYD. The scrapping of the ICE ban is likely a poisonous gift to legacy carmakers, which traded short-term gains for long-term pains.\n\nVolkswagen brands have struggled to sell EVs and are now underwater with huge debt and declining sales. Unsurprisingly, they were among the most vocal in demanding an easing of the combustion engine phase-out. However, it must be pointed out that Volkswagen's situation was akin to a \"controlled flight into terrain\" the moment they decided to delay new EV models and pushed the aging MEB platform to its limits.\n\nVolkswagen has been joined by Ford, also grappling with slow sales of its electric vehicles, most of which are sold in Europe based on the same MEB platform from Volkswagen. Fiat, another carmaker with no plan for the future, also joined the fray and advocated for continuing to sell vehicles with combustion engines in one form or another.\n\nHowever, being allowed to sell gas cars doesn't change the fact that electric vehicles are the only market segment that is growing. The traditional car industry might celebrate a small victory now, but that won't help it overcome Chinese competition or build better EVs in the long term. If anything, it will ensure that legacy carmakers will spend money on the wrong projects while customers will move on.\n\nThe plan change ignores the fact that few people who drive an electric vehicle will ever buy a gas car again. And when they want to replace their vehicle, it's unlikely they will find one worth the money from Volkswagen or Ford. The market is moving too fast, and taking the foot off the gas pedal has already compromised their chances to compete in the future.\n\n\"Moving from a clear 100% zero-emissions target to 90% may seem small, but if we backtrack now, we won't just hurt the climate. We'll hurt Europe's ability to compete,\" Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller warned. His opinion has been shared by other executives in the EV industry, who fear the move will undermine investment and push the EU even further behind China.",

Carmakers in regional industrial powerhouse Germany and in Italy had sought easing of the rules.\n\nThe EU executive appears to have bowed to calls from carmakers to keep selling plug-in hybrids and range extenders that burn fuel as they struggle to compete against Tesla and Chinese electric vehicle makers.\n\n\"Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions,\" said Germany's Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker by volume.\n\nIt added that the draft proposal for new CO2 targets was \"economically sound overall\", and lauded support for small electric vehicles and more flexible targets for 2030.\n\nDominic Phinn, head of transport at non-profit group Climate Group, countered that the measures were a \"tragic win\" for the traditional industry over electric cars.\n\n\"The watering down of the petrol and diesel-engine phase-out flies in the face of leading companies across Europe, who are investing billions in electric fleets and desperately need the stability it provides,\" he said.\n\nUnder Tuesday's proposal, EU targets would shift to a 90% cut in CO2 emissions from 2021 levels, instead of current rules that all new cars and vans from 2035 have zero emissions.\n\nAutomakers would need to offset the remaining emissions by using lower-carbon steel made in the EU and synthetic e-fuels or non-food biofuels such as agricultural waste and used cooking oil. The plan also gives automakers a three-year window from 2030 to 2032 to cut car CO2 emissions by 55% from 2021 levels, while the 2030 target for vans would be eased to 40% from 50%.\n\nEU CLIMATE CLIMB-DOWN AS FORD SCRAPS EVS\n\nThe EU move follows on the heels of U.S. carmaker Ford Motor announcing on Monday a $19.5 billion writedown as it axes several EV models, in response to the Trump administration's policies and weakening EV demand in the United States.\n\nBrokerage Jefferies, however, said that the EU picture was more complex even if there was a global \"reset\" for EVs.\n\n\"The reality is more nuanced: we are likely to see a shift from a clean, all or nothing cut-off, to a more flexible compliance system, marking a turning point in Europe's transition story,\" it said.\n\n\"It's clear the global auto sector is entering a reset moment rather than a straight line to electrification.\"\n\nEuropean carmakers including Volkswagen and Fiat owner Stellantis have also flagged soft EV demand and urged looser targets and lower fines for missing them. Automotive lobby ACEA called the moment \"high noon\" for the sector.\n\nGerman manufacturers are under particular strain as they lose ground in China to local rivals and face growing competition at home from Chinese EV imports. EU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs have offered only limited relief.\n\nHildegard Mueller, president of German auto industry body VDA, said the moves didn't go far enough to support the industry and put new requirements on carmakers in terms of green steel and renewable fuels.\n\n\"The EU had promised to examine the realities, analyse them and, on that basis, introduce flexibility and adjustments. That has not happened - Brussels has disappointed with its draft proposal,\" she said.\n\n\"In times of increasing international competition, in times when European economic power is crucial, this overall package from Brussels is fatal.\"\n\nEU LAGGING CHINA IN EV RACE\n\nThe EV industry warned that easing emissions targets could undermine investment, including in critical charging infrastructure, and leave Europe falling further behind China in the shift to cleaner driving.\n\n\"Moving from a clear 100% zero-emissions target to 90% may seem small, but if we backtrack now, we won't just hurt the climate.

National targets for 2030 and 2035 would be set based on GDP per capita, leaving countries to decide how to meet them.\n\nIndustry groups have cited Belgium's tax breaks for EV company cars as a model.\n\nThe Commission further proposed creating a new regulatory category for small EVs, subject to lighter rules and eligible for extra credits towards CO2 targets if made in the EU.",

Germany and Italy have been among the leading opponents to the rules, stepping up pressure on the EU to relax them, citing that the bloc needs to bolster its industrial competitiveness.\n\n\"We've not abandoned any of our decarbonization goals, but we have shown pragmatism,\" European Commissioner for Industrial Strategy Stephane Sejourne told a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe Commission said carmakers will be able to benefit from \"super credits\" before 2035 for small, affordable EVs made in the EU. The move is aimed at accelerating the roll-out of more small EV models.\n\nRegarding the 2030 targets for cars and vans, the Commission introduced additional flexibility by allowing \"banking and borrowing\" over 2030-2032. It also proposed lowering the 2030 carbon reduction target for vans from 50 percent to 40 percent, citing structurally slower EV uptake in the segment.\n\nIn addition, the Commission announced lower carbon emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles to make it easier to meet the 2030 targets and said it will set member state-level targets for corporate fleets to accelerate the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles.\n\nAs part of a broader Automotive Package, the revision of carmakers' emission targets aims to shore up Europe's car industry as it navigates the transition to clean mobility.\n\nBeyond emission standards, the Commission also unveiled a 1.8-billion-euro (about 2.12 billion U.S. dollars) \"Battery Booster\" plan to accelerate the development of an EU-based battery value chain, with 1.5 billion euros earmarked for interest-free loans to battery cell producers in Europe.\n\nThe package also includes measures to cut red tape and lower compliance costs for manufacturers, the Commission said.\n\nAccording to data released by the European Parliament in 2024, road transport accounts for about a fifth of EU emissions, and passenger cars, a major polluter, produce 61 percent of total carbon emissions from the EU's road transport. (1 euro = 1.18 U.S. dollar)",

      "body": "The EU on Tuesday walked back a 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars seen as a milestone in the fight against climate change, as the bloc pivots to bolstering its crisis-hit auto sector.\n\nUnder proposals slammed by green groups as an act of \"self-sabotage\", carmakers will have to cut exhaust emissions from new vehicles by 90 percent from 2021 levels -- down from an envisaged 100 percent.\n\nThis means that in practice automakers will still be able to sell a limited number of polluting vehicles -- from plug-in hybrids to diesel cars -- beyond 2035, provided the resulting emissions are \"compensated\" in various ways.\n\nThe EU's industry chief, Stephane Sejourne, insisted the bloc's green ambitions stood intact as he put forward a plan billed as a \"lifeline\" for Europe's auto industry.\n\n\"The European Commission has chosen an approach that is both pragmatic and consistent with its climate objectives,\" he told AFP.\n\nThe combustion-engine ban was hailed as a major win in the climate fight and a key tool to drive investments in electrification when adopted in 2023.\n\nBut carmakers and their backers have lobbied hard over the past year for Brussels to relax it, in the face of fierce competition from China and a slower-than-expected shift to electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nEurope's biggest automaker Volkswagen welcomed the move as \"pragmatic\" and \"economically sound\", while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said allowing for \"more openness to technology and greater flexibility\" was the right step.\n\nGermany's leading auto industry group VDA however called the proposals \"disastrous\".\n\n- 'Self-sabotage' -\n\nWeakening the ban is the most striking result yet of a pro-business push that has seen the EU pare back a slew of environmental laws this year -- on the grounds they risk weighing on growth.\n\n\"This backward industrial policy is bad news for jobs, air quality, the climate, and would slow down the supply of affordable electric cars,\" said Greenpeace Germany's executive director, Martin Kaiser.\n\nPost 2035, carmakers will have to compensate for planet-warning emissions spewed by combustion-engine vehicles through credits generated by the use of made-in-Europe, low-carbon steel and e-fuels and biofuels put on the market by energy firms.\n\nBeset by announcements of job cuts and factory closures over the past year, Europe's auto industry -- which employs almost 14 million people and accounts for about seven percent of Europe's GDP -- had maintained that the 2035 goal was no longer realistic.\n\nHigh upfront costs and the lack of adequate charging infrastructure in parts of the 27-nation union mean consumers have been slow to warm to EVs, producers say.\n\nJust over 16 percent of new vehicles sold in the first nine months of 2025 run on batteries, according to industry figures.\n\nCritics, including Spain, France and the Nordic countries, had warned that ditching the ban risked slowing the shift to electric, deterring investments.\n\nWhile the French presidency called the EU's auto plan \"balanced\" overall, the country's environment minister slammed the \"flexibility\" granted for petrol and diesel cars, and said Paris hoped to stop it from becoming law.\n\n\"Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs while China races further ahead,\" said William Todts, director of the clean-transport advocacy group T&E.\n\n\"Weakening the CO2 standards for cars is an act of self-sabotage,\" added Linda Kalcher of Strategic Perspectives, a think tank.\n\n- Green fleets -\n\nThe commission also unveiled a slew of additional measures to support the auto sector as part of a package that needs approval from the EU parliament and member states.\n\nIn the run-up to 2035, carmakers will benefit from \"super credits\" for small \"affordable\" electric cars made in the EU, in an accounting trick that would make reaching emission targets easier.\n\nBrussels also proposed reducing the interim 2030 emission target for vans from 50 to 40 percent and allowing truck manufacturers more time to meet their own 2030 target, in line with a previous concession to automakers.\n\nTo boost EV sales, medium and large firms will be required to green their fleets, which currently account for about 60 percent of new car sales in Europe.\n\nAnd the EU will provide 1.5 billion euros to support European battery producers through interest-free loans.\n\nRoad transport accounts for about 20 percent of total planet-warming emissions in Europe, and 61 percent of those come from cars' exhaust pipes, according to the EU.\n\nub-fpo/ec/db",

      "title": "Carmakers hail EU climbdown on 2035 combustion engine ban",
      "body": "Simply sign up to the Electric vehicles myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBrussels has introduced new flexibilities to allow carmakers to hit 2030 carbon emission targets, as it scrapped its landmark 2035 ban on combustion engines.\n\nThe changes mark a significant retreat for Europe's green ambitions and follow a reversal of climate policy in the US that will lead to more hybrid and petrol vehicles being on roads for longer.\n\nTuesday's announcements followed heavy lobbying from EU car manufacturers and countries, including Germany and Italy, which warned of further massive lay-offs and plant closures without an easing of climate targets.\n\nThe European Commission said on Tuesday that it would soften the path for car manufacturers to meet targets in 2030, which require them to cut emissions by 55 per cent compared with 2021 levels, by allowing them to average out their reductions between 2030 and 2032.\n\nIt also watered down rules that required carmakers to hit zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a flagship part of the bloc's ambitious Green Deal climate law. Instead, manufacturers will be allowed 10 per cent of their 2021 emission levels as long as they make cars using green steel or vehicles that run on renewable fuels.\n\nA further element of the rules are national electrification targets for corporate fleets by 2035. Corporate cars will have to contain a certain level of EU-made components to count towards the targets.\n\nEU executive vice-president St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 insisted the bloc had \"not abandoned any of our decarbonisation goals\" but had shown \"pragmatism in the light of the economic and geopolitical circumstances\".\n\nCarmakers had argued that addressing the 2030 targets was \"urgent\" as they try to fight off competition from cheap Chinese vehicles, US tariffs and high energy prices.\n\n\"What we, and Europe, need is solutions that work for society and the economy. That means: actual technology openness, but as importantly, and actually very urgent, breathing space towards 2030: flexibilities to ease compliance pressure given the lack of demand and infrastructure,\" said Sigrid de Vries, director-general of Acea, the European car industry body.\n\nSome car executives said changes to 2030 targets were as critical as the 2035 ban because it would require a sharp uptake of EVs to hit them.\n\nMassimiliano Messina, head of Nissan's European operations, said in an interview with the Financial Times that he did not expect a slowdown in EV sales as a result of the policy changes.\n\n\"If the purpose [of this revision] is to make sure that the transition happens in a balanced way without creating any impact on the final customer, I think this would be welcome,\" he added.\n\nVolkswagen described the changes as \"economically sound\" but called for even further flexibility in the 2030 targets.\n\nEnvironmental groups condemned the changes.\n\nWilliam Todts, executive director at the campaign group Transport & Environment, said: \"The EU is playing for time when the next game has already started. Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs while China races further ahead.\"\n\nDiscussions between commission officials continued overnight on Monday to decide how much flexibility carmakers should be allowed in the final 10 per cent of emissions in 2035.\n\nConservative politicians successfully pushed for full combustion engines to still be allowed, alongside so-called \"mild hybrids\", which have a small electric motor and battery alongside a traditional engine. Liberal and socialist governments argued for only plug-in hybrids and range extenders, which combine a small fuel cell with an electric battery, to be allowed.\n\n\"There is blood all over the floor of the Berlaymont,\" said one senior EU official, referring to the commission's building.\n\nCountries such as Sweden and Spain had argued that weakening the combustion engine ban would send the wrong signal to manufacturers and create uncertainty in the market. But eastern European countries along with Germany and Italy lobbied hard for the ban to be weakened.\n\nEU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra insisted the \"big bet\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009will continue to be electric\".\n\nThe commission has also decided to lower the emissions reduction target for vans to 40 per cent in 2030, down from 50 per cent, \"because the demand is simply not there\", one official said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Barbara Moens in Brussels and Sebastien Ash in Frankfurt",

      "body": "The audio version of this article is generated by AI-based technology. Mispronunciations can occur. We are working with our partners to continually review and improve the results.\n\nThe EU is scrapping its plan to ban all sales of new combustion-engine cars in a decade, following pressure from big automakers and some member states.\n\nThe European Commission, which proposes regulations for the 27-country bloc, announced some breathing room that effectively removes the previous hard target -- where all new sales had to be zero-emission vehicles -- and allows plug-in hybrids, hybrids and even combustion-engine vehicles to continue to be sold beyond 2035.\n\n\"In practice, 90 per cent of vehicles will be electric,\" said European climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra at a news conference in Strasbourg, France. \"For the remaining 10 per cent, we allow flexibility.\"\n\nThe proposal, which still requires approval from member states and the European Parliament, says automakers can make up that 10 per cent through the use of sustainable renewable fuels or using lower-emissions steel made in Europe.\n\nThis is the second adjustment from the Commission for Europe's auto sector, having already introduced flexibilities on how emissions would be counted earlier this year.\n\nThis comes as Canada weighs its own electric vehicle future, and the U.S. recommits to gas cars -- all while automakers struggle against Chinese EV dominance.\n\nWhile Hoekstra described this as a \"win-win\" for all, some critics see it as a distraction from an ambitious plan that would significantly lower Europe's emissions.\n\n\"The world is going electric and this will happen with or without Europe,\" said Lucien Mathieu, director of the cars program at Transport & Environment, a group of non-governmental organizations. \"What Europe risks doing -- by clinging to the combustion engine and to the hybrids -- is investing in these technologies that will be outdated.\"\n\nOther experts see today's move as a fair compromise, adjusting to current economic pressures for automakers.\n\n\"I think that the EU is taking a pragmatic approach,\" said Joanna Kyriazis, director of policy and strategy at Clean Energy Canada. \"All countries with domestic auto sectors are revisiting their policy landscape to figure out what's possible, what's reasonable.\"\n\n\"Hundred per cent is always a problematic goal,\" said Gil Tal, director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at University of California, Davis. \"Banning gas cars, it may be great all the way to 90 and then very, very, very costly the last 10 per cent.\"\n\nIn the months leading up to Tuesday's proposed tweaks, there had been intense lobbying and pressure campaigns.\n\nIn a recent letter, six EU leaders called for allowing more fuel-efficient vehicles in order to \"pursue our climatic goal in an effective way, while not killing our competitiveness.\" A counter argument, signed by a couple hundred members of Europe's electric vehicle industry, warned that diluting the goal would risk \"deeper dependency, lost influence, and falling irreversibly behind.\"\n\nThe under- and overtone of both letters was the elephant in the room: China, the clear global front-runner in electric vehicle production and sales.\n\nKyriazis says Chinese-made EVs are low-cost, high quality challengers, but their dominance isn't complete. While Europe has allowed them to be sold at a lower tariff rate than Canada and the U.S., they account for about 10 per cent of electric car sales.\n\n\"The fear has been that these EVs are just going to take over and kill domestic industry. And while they are popular vehicles among drivers, they haven't quite taken over,\" Kyriazis said.\n\nBut others see any slowing down from Europe as an open lane for China.\n\n\"This is a global race to electric cars,\" Mathieu told CBC News from Brussels. \"China is currently racing ahead, and Europe will not be able to catch up by investing in the technologies of yesterday.\"\n\nToday's proposed shift isn't a complete reversal, unlike U.S. President Donald Trump's scrapping of EV mandates and tax credits as well as slashing fuel economy standards for gasoline vehicles. But experts say the climbdown will be watched around the world.\n\n\"It sends a message of mixed signals, a message of hesitation,\" Mathieu described, adding that the proposals serve as a compass for EV investment.\n\n\"We see today that it's hundreds of billions of euros invested in electric technology ... all of those investments can be jeopardized if we change the targets while we're just starting or in the middle of this transition.\"\n\nTo ease tariff and trade pressures, Prime Minister Mark Carney paused Canada's electric vehicle sales targets, which also demanded all new Canadian car sales be electric by 2035.\n\n\"Canada's at an inflection point right now,\" Kyriazis said, explaining that it can follow the U.S. example or adjust its plans slightly, as the EU is doing. \"I'm hoping ... we take a similar approach of tweaking the policy to respond to this moment in time, while maintaining a clear market signal and commitment to electrification.\"\n\nAnd experts agree that whatever the road looks like to get there, getting off gas cars is worth the bumps along the way.\n\n\"Decarbonizing the light-duty vehicle sector is the closest thing to a silver bullet we have,\" Tal told CBC News.\n\n\"It's the one policy, the one technology that actually works, that can make a huge difference.\"",

      "title": "EU moves to ease 2035 ban on internal combustion cars as auto industry faces headwinds",
      "body": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- European officials on Tuesday moved to ease their ban on sales of cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, responding to pressure from governments and automakers who argued that the industry needed more flexibility in finding ways to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and help achieve EU climate goals.\n\nThe proposal from the EU's executive commission would change provisions of 2023 legislation requiring average emissions in new cars to equal zero, or a 100% reduction from 2021 levels.\n\nThe new proposal would require a 90% emissions reduction. That means in practical terms that most cars would be battery-only but would leave room for some cars with internal combustion engines.\n\nAutomakers would have to compensate for the added emissions by using European steel produced by methods that emit less carbon, and through use of climate neutral e-fuels made from renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide and biofuels made from plants.\n\nEU officials say changing the limit will not affect progress toward making the 27-country bloc's economy climate neutral by 2050. That means producing only as much carbon dioxide as can be absorbed by forests and oceans or by abatement methods such as storing it underground. CO2 is the primary greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for climate change.\n\nThe less stringent limit would leave room for automakers to continue selling some plug-in hybrids, which have both electric and internal combustion engines and can use the combustion engine to recharge the battery without the need to find a charging station. The new limit proposal was accompanied by measures to promote European battery production and small electric cars.\n\nThe move, which needs approval from member governments and the EU parliament, follows appeals from major carmakers and governments like those of Germany and Italy that are host to major manufacturers and were concerned about the impact on an industry that remains a major employer.\n\nIndustry representatives say that charging infrastructure is not being built quickly enough to persuade consumers to switch from gasoline and diesel models to electric cars. Other factors are also blamed for slowing the increase in demand for electric cars such as the cancelation of purchase subsidies by the German government and higher prices for European-made electric cars. At the same time, the industry is under pressure from increasing sales of inexpensive Chinese cars and a car market that remains smaller than before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSales of battery only cars in Europe rose 26% for the first 10 months of this year compared to the same period last year. Electric-only cars rose to 16% of new car sales.\n\nThe easing of the emissions ban would sends \"a confusing signal\" to automakers and consumers, said environmental lobby Transport & Environment. \"This will divert investment away from electrification at a time when European manufacturers urgently need to catch up with Chinese EV-makers.\"\n\nBoth the EU and the U.S. are moving more slowly in adopting electric cars than China, where battery vehicles were 34% of the market in the third quarter. Growth of battery cars in China has been fueled by state assistance and ferocious competition among Chinese automakers producing affordable vehicles.\n\nEarlier this month, President Donald Trump announced a plan to significantly reduce fuel economy requirements in the U.S. The suggested standards, if finalized in 2026, would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden previously set much more stringent rules that would have required automakers to meet about 50.4 miles per gallon on average across their fleets that model year.\n\nIndustry applauded Trump's rule change, which aligns with the president's oil and gas industry-forward agenda and other measures prolonging sales of internal combustion engine vehicles, including relaxing auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealing fines for automakers not meeting federal mileage standards and eliminating EV incentives.\n\nThe state of California had also proposed a ban on sales of new internal combustion cars from 2035 but was blocked by Congress.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press writer Alexa St. John contributed from Detroit.\n\nNews Nevada Top stories Holiday Spirit food baskets bring Christmas breakfast to families in need RTC to host public information meeting on Northeast Connector study Wednesday Reno teen reported missing last week found, returns home",

      "body": "The European Union is preparing to ease the previously set ban on the sale of new cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, due to pressures from countries like Germany and Italy and the automotive sector. The target for car manufacturers to reduce exhaust emissions by 100% from 2035 will be updated to 90%. The remaining 10% of emissions can be offset through the use of low-carbon steel produced in Europe, e-fuels, and biofuels.\n\nThe European Commission has shared a regulatory proposal called the \"automotive package,\" which includes changes to emission rules for new cars.\n\nAccording to the package, the future carbon emission standards targeted for cars and light commercial vehicles will be revised. The goal for car manufacturers to reduce exhaust emissions by 100% starting in 2035 will be updated to 90%. The remaining 10% of emissions can be offset through the use of low-carbon steel produced in the EU, e-fuels, and biofuels.\n\nThus, the ban on the sale of new cars with internal combustion engines, which will be effective from 2035, will be eased. In EU countries, plug-in hybrids, range-extended vehicles, and mild hybrids with internal combustion engines will be allowed to be sold after 2035.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of more small electric models to the European market will be encouraged. For this, car manufacturers will be able to benefit from favorable loans for small and affordable electric vehicles produced in the EU.\n\nTo support the battery industry in Europe, an interest-free loan of 1.5 billion euros will be provided to the sector. Bureaucratic processes in the sector will be reduced to alleviate the administrative burden on European car manufacturers and lower their costs. The package will come into effect after approval from EU countries and the European Parliament (EP).\n\nThe law that will impose strict carbon emission standards on new cars in line with the EU's climate goals was approved by the European Parliament in 2023. The law stipulated that all new cars and light commercial vehicles sold in EU member countries must be zero-emission starting in 2035. Particularly, EU countries with advanced car manufacturing capacities, such as Germany and Italy, were demanding a change in the target for all new cars sold within the EU to be zero-emission starting in 2035.\n\nMajor car manufacturers in Europe were also calling for more support for the sector, a reduction in the EU's carbon emission targets, the lifting of the ban on the sale of cars with internal combustion engines in 2035, and making the purchase of domestically produced electric cars attractive in European countries. Approximately 13 million people are employed in the automotive sector in Europe.",

      "body": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday welcomed a proposal by the European Commission to reverse a ban on new combustion-engine vehicles from 2035 after pressure from ailing carmakers.\n\nMerz praised the EU's executive arm over the proposed changes to regulation \"after the clear signal\" from Berlin.\n\n\"More openness to technology and more flexibility are the right steps to take in order to better align climate targets, market realities, businesses and jobs,\" he said in Berlin.\n\nUnder the revised plans, carmakers will have to comply with a 90% tailpipe emissions reduction target compared to 2021, instead of a 100% reduction.\n\nThe remaining 10% emissions will need to be compensated through European low-carbon steel, e-fuels or biofuels, the commission said.\n\n\"This will allow for plug-in hybrids (PHEV), range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal combustion engine vehicles to still play a role beyond 2035, in addition to full electric (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles,\" a press release issued on Tuesday said.\n\nThe EU had decided in 2022 that from 2035 new cars and vans sold in the bloc could no longer emit climate-damaging carbon dioxide, effectively ending the registration of new vehicles with traditional combustion engines, as part of efforts to cut transport emissions.\n\nAfter sustained appeals, including from the government in Berlin and Germany's car industry, the commission announced it would review the phase-out regulation.\n\nMerz said the proposals by the commission, which still need to be scrutinized and agreed to by EU member countries and the European Parliament, would now be reviewed.\n\nPromoting new technologies and avoiding additional red tape should be top priorities, he added.\n\nGerman Environment Minister Carten Schneider also praised the proposed changes. \"The rules are becoming more flexible, but the climate impact remains the same,\" he said.\n\nEurope's ailing car industry has been struggling with increasing Chinese competition and the transition to electric vehicles, resulting in losses and major job cuts.\n\n\"Europe's automotive sector has reached a crossroads. We need to act now to ensure it remains an integral part of Europe's industrial future, not just its heritage,\" said EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\nAccording to the commission, the automotive industry contributes 7% to the EU's gross domestic product and provides almost 14 million jobs.\n\nThe commission also presented incentives for carmakers to market more small and affordable electric cars made in the EU, as well as measures to increase the share of European-built low- or zero-emission cars in corporate fleets.\n\nThe commission said that revising the agreed phase-out of combustion engine vehicle does not mean moving away from the EU's long-term goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2050.\n\n\"We want our industries to be the leaders of the transition to a low-carbon economy because that is what is best for our climate, competitiveness and independence,\" said EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra.\n\n\"We are introducing flexibilities for manufacturers, and in turn this will have to be compensated with low-carbon steel and the use of sustainable fuels to drive down emissions,\" he said.\n\n\"We maintain investment predictability in the electric sector, drive down emissions and stay on track for climate neutrality by 2050.\"",

      "title": "Europe to allow the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles beyond 2035",
      "body": "The European Commission has published proposals which would allow carmakers to continue selling petrol and diesel cars beyond 2035.\n\nExisting rules in the EU require new vehicles sold from that date to be zero emission, but with the automotive sector lobbying for concessions, new, weaker targets have been published.\n\nUnder the European Commission's new plan, 90% of new cars sold from 2035 would have to be zero-emission, rather than 100%.\n\nThe remaining 10% could be made up of conventional petrol or diesel cars, along with hybrids.\n\nThe flexibilities being proposed on sales targets, meanwhile, would be conditional on carmakers gaining credits for green steel in vehicle manufacturing.\n\nCarmakers will also be awarded credits for advanced biofuels and e-fuels in Europe's fuel mix.\n\nIt will also make it a prerequisite for zero- or low-emission vehicles to be made in the EU to benefit from public financial support.\n\nFurthermore, the European Commission (EC) is proposing to decarbonise corporate fleets with binding national targets for zero- and low-emission vehicles.\n\nFrom 2030, member states will need to ensure that a specific share of new corporate cars and vans registered in their territories are zero- or low-emission.\n\nMandatory national targets will be set by each member state, with a minimum sub-target for zero-emissions vehicles, with what it describes as \"full flexibility\" for countries to choose the best measures to achieve the targets.\n\nEuropean Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen von der Leyen, said that innovation, clean mobility and competitiveness were the \"top priorities\" in discussions with automotive sector.\n\n\"As technology rapidly transforms mobility and geopolitics reshapes global competition, Europe remains at the forefront of the global clean transition,\" she added.\n\nWilliam Todts, executive director at environmental lobby group Transport and Environment (T&E), says that electrifying corporate fleets is the \"low hanging fruit\" of European industrial policy and \"it's great to see the Commission taking action on this\".\n\nHowever, he said: \"We should be aiming for large companies to go fully electric in a market that is propped up by tens of billions in publicly funded tax breaks.\"\n\nT&E also warned that reversing the EU's 2035 phase-out of combustion engine sales sends a confusing signal to the European car industry and consumers.\n\nIt claims it will divert investment away from electrification at a time when European manufacturers urgently need to catch up with Chinese EV-makers.\n\nT&E calculates that it would mean up to 25% fewer battery electric vehicles would be sold in 2035 than under the current target. However, it anticipates that batter electric vehicles (BEVs) will still dominate the car market from 2030 onwards.\n\nIt says that fuels credits would allow carmakers to sell fewer EVs in return for non-existent emissions savings.\n\nIn the case of advanced biofuels, which it says cannot be scaled sustainably, they would also increase Europe's reliance on imports of used cooking oil and animal fats, often subject to fraud, according to T&E.\n\nTodts says that the EU has \"chosen complexity over clarity\".\n\n\"Breeding faster horses could never have halted the ascent of the automobile,\" he added.\n\n\"Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on EVs while China races further ahead. Clinging to combustion engines won't make European automakers great again.\"\n\nPrior to 2035, the EC is proposing that manufacturers will be able to benefit from \"super credits\" for small affordable electric cars made in the EU.\n\nThis, it says, will incentivise the deployment on the market of more small EV models.\n\nAn additional flexibility is also granted for the vans segment, where the electric vehicle uptake has been structurally more difficult, with a reduction of the 2030 CO2 vans target from 50% to 40%.\n\nThe Commission is also proposing a targeted amendment to the CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles with a flexibility easing the compliance with the 2030 targets.\n\nT&E says that the EU's plan to promote the production of small EVs could result in fewer electric cars being sold.\n\nEvery small electric car sold would count as 1.3 zero-emission cars towards a carmaker's CO2 target, reducing the number of EVs they would need to sell overall.\n\nThe small EV supercredits would be conditional on the cars meeting local content requirements.\n\nChris Heron, secretary general of E-Mobility Europe, said: \"While China accelerates, Europe is hesitating, and hesitation is not a strategy.\n\n\"Changing the rules midway through the game undermines business confidence after companies have already committed capital and built factories around a 100% trajectory.\n\n\"But once the dust settles, we're confident the core of the 2035 framework will still matter more for the market than today's exemptions.\n\n\"By 2035, demand for electric vehicles will be shaped by their superior cost, efficiency, and technology maturity. Europe's long-term competitiveness will be most certain when its policies reinforce that trajectory.\"\n\nImplications for the UK\n\nThe European Commission's proposal also has significant implications for the UK, which is currently legislating its own pathway to zero-emission vehicles through the ZEV mandate.\n\nIndustry leaders have warned that any move by the UK to follow Europe's lead by weakening targets or expanding exemptions would risk undermining hard-won investment certainty at a critical moment for the British EV sector.\n\nHeron continued: \"From a European perspective, the UK would be mad to follow our example. It's the wrong time to take the wind out of EV sales.\n\n\"Electric car markets are growing strongly, yet by reopening the door to plug-ins, hybrids, and unscalable biofuels, we slow ourselves down in a highly competitive global race.\n\n\"We know the future of transport is electric; what isn't settled is who will build that future, and who will win the investment, jobs and industrial advantage that comes with it.\n\n\"Our message to Westminster is simple: hold the line on ambition, give industry certainty, and don't muddy the picture just as the transition is accelerating.\"\n\nJust last weekend, the Conservatives pledged to scrap UK plans to end the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles, if they win the next election.\n\nIn the UK, all new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, with hybrids allowed to be sold until 2035,\n\nDelvin Lane, CEO of InstaVolt, said: \"If parts of Europe slow down on 2035, the UK has a real opportunity by holding firm on ZEV.\n\n\"Policy certainty brings investment, not just in vehicles, but in charging infrastructure at scale. We're already seeing strong demand for EVs, backed by a rapidly expanding, reliable charging network that gives drivers confidence to make the switch.\n\n\"Staying the course wouldn't be a risk; it would be a competitive advantage for the UK market.\"\n\nFiona Howarth, founder and director at Octopus Electric Vehicles, added: \"Softening EV policy doesn't protect industry - it gives others a head start.\n\n\"In the global EV race, commitment wins. If Europe slows, the UK can take the lead. Strong policies like the ZEV mandate give carmakers, investors, and drivers what matters most: certainty - unlocking investment, jobs and faster, cheaper electric cars.\"\n\nThe legislative proposals on car CO2 standards, corporate fleets, and small EVs must be debated and agreed on by the EU Parliament and national governments before entering into force.\n\nAn Industrial Accelerator Act, to define what counts as 'made-in-EU' EVs and batteries, will be published in January.",

      "title": "1st LD: EU eases 2035 zero-emission requirements for new cars",
      "body": "BRUSSELS, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on Tuesday that it would ease the planned 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars by shifting to a target requiring carmakers to cut tailpipe emissions by 90 percent. The remaining 10 percent would be offset by the use of low carbon steel made in the European Union (EU), or from e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nUnder the Automotive Package proposed by the Commission, automakers could still sell some non-fully electric vehicles (EVs) after 2035, such as plug-in hybrids, range extenders and mild hybrids, alongside fully electric and hydrogen models.\n\nThis would mark a shift from the EU rules adopted in 2023, which set a 100 percent carbon reduction target for new cars and vans from 2035.\n\nThe Commission said carmakers will be able to benefit from \"super credits\" before 2035 for small, affordable EVs made in the EU. The move is aimed at accelerating the roll-out of more small EV models.\n\nRegarding the 2030 targets for cars and vans, the Commission introduced additional flexibility by allowing \"banking and borrowing\" over 2030-2032. It also proposed lowering the 2030 carbon reduction target for vans from 50 percent to 40 percent, citing structurally slower EV uptake in the segment.\n\nThe Commission also proposed amending carbon emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles to make it easier to meet the 2030 targets and said it will set member state-level targets for corporate fleets to accelerate the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles.",

      "body": "The European Commission on Tuesday unveiled a new automotive package aimed at giving carmakers greater flexibility to meet CO2 emissions targets, while reinforcing support for vehicles and batteries produced in the EU.\n\nThe package maintains the bloc's commitment to climate neutrality by 2050 and clean mobility by 2035, but introduces new flexibilities in emissions rules for cars, vans and heavy-duty vehicles, alongside measures to cut red tape and strengthen Europe's battery industry, according to a statement.\n\nUnder the revised framework, carmakers will still be required to achieve a 90% reduction in fleet-wide tailpipe emissions by 2035. However, the remaining 10% of emissions can be compensated through the use of low-carbon steel made in the EU, as well as e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nThis flexibility enables technologies such as plug-in hybrids, range extenders, and combustion engine vehicles to remain on the market alongside electric and hydrogen vehicles.\n\nTo ease near-term pressure, the commission introduced \"super credits\" for small, affordable electric cars made in the EU, a banking-and-borrowing system for 2030-2032, and lowered the 2030 CO2 reduction target for vans from 50% to 40%.\n\nThe package also includes a \u20ac1.8 billion ($2.1 billion) Battery Booster to strengthen the EU battery value chain and an Automotive Omnibus expected to cut administrative costs for manufacturers by about \u20ac706 million ($831 million) annually.\n\nMeasures include streamlined testing procedures, exemptions for electric vans from certain regulatory requirements, and the removal of duplicate noise regulations.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, European Commission Executive Vice President Stephane Sejourne said the objective of decarbonization by 2035 remains unchanged, but \"the modalities of calculation are changing,\" introducing flexibilities that do not undermine the overall climate goal.\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Climate Wopke Hoekstra described the package as \"ambitious, balanced and pragmatic,\" saying it addresses industry concerns, while preserving investment predictability in the electric vehicle sector and upholding EU climate law.\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, European commissioner for economy and productivity, said the revised rules introduce \"real technological neutrality,\" while giving consumers more choice and manufacturers more flexibility, without abandoning climate objectives.",

      "title": "EU Commission weakens CO\u2082 targets - a little bit - electrive.com",
      "body": "Negotiations on the exact contents of the EU Commission's 'Automotive Package' continued down to the wire. While the once-fixed CO2 target for 2035 has been softened, it comes with several important conditions and additional regulations. We summarize what has been decided, outline the implications, and highlight where critical information is still missing.\n\nSomething was different this Tuesday. When the EU Commission prepares to present proposals for politically significant initiatives, more or less complete drafts of the legislative package usually circulate in relevant circles days or even hours before the announcement. However, this was not the case for the \"Auto Package\". Ever since EPP politician Manfred Weber pushed last week for a reduction in CO\u2082 emissions of only 90 percent instead of 100 percent by 2035, Brussels has been unusually quiet. Strikingly quiet.\n\nThere is a simple reason for this: apparently, there was no final draft until the very last minute that could have been circulated. Negotiations behind closed doors continued until the end, with even the Commission itself lacking genuine agreement on many details. While it had already become clear that the Commission's original CO\u2082 target for 2035 would be softened, the extent, measures, and restrictions remained uncertain until the very end.\n\nWhat the EU Commission ultimately presented in Strasbourg at the seat of the EU Parliament broadly aligns with what Weber announced last week: for 2035, a CO\u2082 reduction target of 90 percent compared to 2021 has been set, which de facto corresponds to a fleet CO\u2082 emission of eleven grammes per kilometre -- instead of zero grammes. The Commission also does not specify a date for the 100 percent target, as Weber had similarly suggested. The EU Commission estimates that this will result in 27 to 29 percent of new registrations still featuring an internal combustion engine after 2035.\n\nNot only will plug-in hybrids and vehicles with range extenders remain permitted after 2035, but so will mild hybrids and pure combustion engines -- this appears to be a clear victory for conservative forces like Weber and Chancellor Friedrich Merz. However, there is a significant caveat: the conditions, which Weber did not mention, could -- and likely will -- severely limit this \"victory\" in practice.\n\nThe CO\u2082 emissions that new combustion engines will still produce after 2035 must be offset. A credit system is planned, requiring manufacturers to compensate for combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, and range extenders sold after 2035. This can be achieved through measures such as using green steel from the European Union in their vehicles or climate-neutral fuels like biofuels or the controversial e-fuels. Up to three percent of the 2021 reference target (or, in other words, 30 percent of the remaining permitted emissions) can be credited through clean fuels, while green steel accounts for seven percent of the reference target or 70 percent of the remaining permitted emissions.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear how stringent these requirements will be in practice. Whether a car manufacturer can actually use green steel in their vehicles and power them with e-fuels by 2035 will depend heavily on the availability of green steel and such clean fuels at that time -- and on their costs. Consequently, this will determine who can afford such vehicles after 2035.\n\nOther aspects, however, are more concrete: so-called \"super credits\" are intended to promote small and affordable electric vehicles (EVs). EVs shorter than 4.20 metres will be weighted more heavily in a manufacturer's fleet emissions calculations. In practical terms: a sold ID. Polo would not count as one vehicle in Volkswagen's fleet emissions calculation but as 1.3 vehicles. \"This will create incentives for the market introduction of more small electric vehicle models,\" the Commission states. This proposal is likely to originate from Spain and France. Both countries had already advocated in autumn for maintaining the 2035 CO\u2082 target with only slight additional flexibility, preferring to promote EVs through measures like super credits.\n\nAs with the CO\u2082 regulations from 2025 onwards, the path to the adjusted 2035 target will also be made somewhat more flexible. Specifically, the previously fixed interim target for 2030 may be extended analogously to the current regulation from 2025 to 2027. Instead of meeting fixed annual targets, manufacturers will be required to achieve the interim targets over the period from 2030 to 2032. If they exceed the target in 2030, this will not immediately result in penalties. There will still be an opportunity to offset the shortfall through greater savings in subsequent years. \"Additional flexibility will be granted for the van segment, where the adoption of electric vehicles has been structurally more challenging, with the CO\u2082 target for 2030 reduced from 50 percent to 40 percent,\" the Commission states.\n\nAdditionally, the EU Commission plans to introduce specific targets for the electrification of company cars for member states from 2030 onwards -- with varying requirements for each country. \"To support the adoption of zero- and low-emission vehicles by large companies,\" as officially stated. Large companies are defined in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU. However, how EU countries implement these targets will be left to the member states. The successful company car taxation model in Belgium, which has led to a significant increase in electric vehicle sales, is seen as a blueprint. How Germany will implement this remains to be seen, but company car privileges for EVs are likely to increase.\n\n\"More zero- and low-emission vehicles on the market, for both new and used cars, will benefit all customers. Since company cars cover higher annual mileages, this will also lead to greater emissions reductions. Furthermore, zero- or low-emission vehicles and 'Made in the EU' will become a precondition for vehicles receiving financial support from public funds,\" the Commission states. Sixty percent of new cars and 90 percent of new vans are registered by companies -- so the leverage is significant.\n\nAccording to Bild newspaper, a list from the Commission reportedly sets a 100 percent EV quota for large customers in Germany by 2035 -- similarly for France, Finland, Austria, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. For Spain, the quota is set at 66 percent, while for Bulgaria, it is around 32 percent. According to Handelsblatt, the quotas are based on economic strength and the current share of electric vehicles.\n\nA 100 percent quota here would mean that large customers (including major corporations and car rental companies) would only be allowed to procure and register new battery-electric vehicles. Initially, a 100 percent quota for corporate customers was discussed as early as 2030. However, this has now been pushed back by five years and applies only to large customers. The fleet customer target for 2030 in Germany is reportedly set at 54 percent. Fleets of small and medium-sized enterprises are exempt.\n\nFurthermore, the EU Commission plans to allocate 1.8 billion euros for a \"Battery Booster\" to accelerate a \"fully EU-based battery value chain.\" This includes interest-free loans for battery cell manufacturers and supportive political measures. \"These measures will improve the cost competitiveness of the sector, secure upstream supply chains, and support sustainable and resilient production in the EU, contributing to a shift away from dominant global market players,\" the Commission states.\n\nNot only in the battery sector but for the entire automotive industry, bureaucratic requirements are set to be adjusted. This aims to reduce the administrative burden on companies, with the Commission estimating annual savings of 706 million euros. Among other things, it is proposed to reduce the number of secondary regulations to be adopted in the coming years and to streamline testing for new passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nThe Commission also proposes a targeted amendment to the CO\u2082 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles to make compliance with the 2030 targets more flexible -- though no specific figures have been provided yet. \"The targeted amendment will allow manufacturers to accumulate more emission credits in the years leading up to 2030 than under the current regulation. While the regulation currently only permits manufacturers to earn credits if their CO\u2082 emissions fall below a linear CO\u2082 emission reduction path, the proposal would allow them to generate credits as soon as their CO\u2082 emissions fall below their annual CO\u2082 emission target,\" the Commission explains.\n\nThe rationale behind all these adjustments and regulations is clear: the European automotive industry is not only facing a major technological transformation but also fierce competition -- \"of unprecedented speed and scale,\" as the EU puts it. \"It is therefore extremely important to ensure the competitiveness of the industry and support it in transitioning to clean mobility and decarbonising road transport.\" This year's EU strategic dialogue with the automotive sector has given companies the opportunity to clearly communicate their positions and needs in Brussels. The Commission has therefore brought forward the previously agreed review of the regulations by one year and is offering the industry slightly more flexibility. In doing so, the Commission is deviating from its previous course -- but only slightly.\n\nThe Commission describes the package of measures as \"the first industrial strategy for the automotive industry.\" \"It ensures climate, industry, and economic coherence. It includes elements and prerequisites for a future-proof, clean, and competitive automotive sector and encourages manufacturers to continue investing in zero-emission vehicles,\" states a Q&A on the \"Auto Package.\" \"It provides more flexibility and technology neutrality in the CO\u2082 standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, as well as targeted flexibility for heavy-duty vehicles, to achieve our climate goals, and supports the adoption of zero- and low-emission vehicles in corporate fleets. The future is electric.\"\n\nThe crucial point, however, is this: all the changes mentioned here are currently only proposals from the EU Commission and not yet final regulations or laws. To push the \"Auto Package\" through, the EU Parliament must first approve it (where Weber's EPP is the largest group), and the member states must then give their green light in the EU Council.\n\nThe latter is far from certain: the Commission has likely framed the \"Auto Package\" so broadly to offer something to as many countries as possible. Alongside Germany, six other EU countries (all with relatively low shares of electric vehicles in their new registrations) had pushed for a weakening of CO\u2082 targets and in favour of combustion engines. Other countries, such as Spain, France, Denmark, and Belgium, are pursuing a significantly more ambitious electric course.\n\nA simple majority is sufficient in the EU Parliament, but a so-called \"qualified majority\" is required in the EU Council. This means the approval of at least 15 countries, representing at least 65 percent of the EU population, is needed.\n\nThis is far from guaranteed. Changes to the \"Auto Package\" are therefore possible, as is complete failure. And in that case, the target agreed in 2023 would still apply: zero grammes of CO\u2082 from 2035!",

      "body": "Under the European Union's (EU) proposed plan, new combustion engines would have effectively been banned after 2035. But with EV enthusiasm cooling and more automakers reinvesting in combustion technology, the EU has officially decided to loosen its restrictions.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the EU has revised its ambitious 2035 goal and plans to ease restrictions on combustion engines. The original proposition aimed to reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles' tailpipes by 100 percent compared to 2021 numbers by forcing automakers to go fully electric.\n\nNow, officials say the goal is to cut CO2 emissions by 90 percent compared to 2021. That means hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and range-extended EVs will be allowed to remain on sale past 2035. The other 10 percent of emissions will need to be offset with things like lower-carbon steel produced in the EU, or synthetic e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nIt's long been rumored that the EU would lift restrictions. Earlier this month, it was reported that the EU was considering reversing the decision. And earlier this week, the head of the European People's Party (EPP), confirmed the news to the German newspaper Bild, saying:\n\n'For new registrations from 2035 onwards, a 90-percent reduction in CO2 emissions will now be mandatory for car manufacturers' fleet targets, instead of 100 percent. There will also be no 100-percent target from 2040 onwards. This means that the technology ban on combustion engines is off the table. All engines currently built in Germany can therefore continue to be produced and sold.'\n\nAutomakers will be granted a three-year window between 2030 and 2032 to reduce car CO2 emissions by 55 percent compared to 2021 levels. The requirement for vans, meanwhile, will drop from 50 to 40 percent.\n\nThis decision comes following pressure from the German, Italian, and European auto sectors. Brands like Volkswagen Group and Stellantis specifically said the proposal would be difficult to meet. The EU finally agrees.",

Automotive lobby ACEA called the moment \"high noon\" for the sector.\n\nGerman manufacturers are under particular strain as they lose ground in China to local rivals and face growing competition at home from Chinese EV imports, despite the EU levying tariffs on Chinese-built EVs.\n\nThe EV industry warned that easing emissions targets could undermine investment and leave Europe falling further behind China in the shift to cleaner driving.\n\n\"Moving from a clear 100 percent zero-emissions target to 90 percent may seem small, but if we backtrack now, we won't just hurt the climate. We'll hurt Europe's ability to compete,\" said Michael Lohscheller, CEO of Swedish EV manufacturer Polestar.\n\nWilliam Todts, executive director of clean transport advocacy group T&E, said the EU was playing for time while China was racing ahead.\n\n\"Clinging to combustion engines won't make European automakers great again,\" he said.\n\nThe Commission also outlined plans to boost EV uptake in corporate fleets, which account for about 60 percent of new car sales in Europe. National targets for 2030 and 2035 would be set based on GDP per capita, leaving countries to decide how to meet them.\n\nIndustry groups have cited Belgium's tax breaks for EV company cars as a model.\n\nThe Commission further proposed creating a new regulatory category for small EVs, subject to lighter rules and eligible for extra credits towards CO2 targets if made in the EU.",

      "title": "It's Official: European Union Axes Plans to Ban Internal Combustion Cars by 2035",
      "body": "The U.S. is no longer alone in its regulatory walk-back regarding electric vehicles. On Tuesday, the European Commission announced plans to backtrack on the European Union's plan to effectively ban the sale of internal combustion-powered vehicles after 2035, allowing for the continued sale of non-electric vehicles. The move comes amid growing pressures from automobile producing nations like Germany and Italy.\n\nUnder the now-outgoing EU regulations, all new cars sold from 2035 on would have needed to be zero-emission vehicles. Practically speaking, this would ban internal-combustion engine-powered cars from sale, prioritizing the rapid adoption of battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. The new proposal announced today requires 90 percent of vehicles sold after 2035 to be zero emissions, allowing for a slower uptick in EV adoption as the decade rolls on, while also letting automakers to continue providing hybrids and range-extended EVs, and offsetting their emissions with technology like synthetic gasoline and biofuels.\n\nThe move sees Europe move to more closely align with the United States current policy under President Donald Trump. The eased regulations also aim to give Europe's automakers a chance to compete with affordable electric vehicle offerings from Chinese companies and American ones like Tesla. According to Forbes, the former group established a 10-percent market share in Europe through mid-2025, led by brands like MG, BYD, and Chery. By easing the regulations and offering more powertrain variety, European customers may not be as tempted by the simple affordability of a Chinese EV.\n\nOf course, the announcement is also a positive one for fans of Europe's sports car brands. Such a move should allow the likes of Porsche, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, and Lamborghini to continue building engines, albeit with some electric assist or synthetic fueling. Porsche has already invested heavily in the latter, and all of the brands have already proved how effective hybrids can be. (Perhaps there are still some new V-12s in our future yet.) That said, hopefully these regulatory changes will the entire car buying process easier -- and less expensive -- for the average EU consumer.",

      "title": "Europe backtracks on ban of new combustion engine cars, in setback to tackling climate change",
      "body": "London (CNN) -- Plans to ban the sale of new combustion engine cars in the European Union by 2035 have been thrown into turmoil after pressure from car manufacturers.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission proposed applying the ban, approved in 2023, to only 90% of vehicles, down from 100%. This means the remaining 10% of new cars made after 2035 could still be plug-in hybrid vehicles or those with internal combustion engines.\n\nThe move, unveiled by the EU's executive arm alongside other measures to support the bloc's car industry, represents a setback for tackling climate change, although the commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe remains \"at the forefront of the global clean transition.\"\n\n\"From 2035 onwards, carmakers will need to comply with a 90% tailpipe emissions reduction target, while the remaining 10% emissions will need to be compensated through the use of low-carbon steel ... or from e-fuels and biofuels,\" the European Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe proposal is likely to be approved by European lawmakers. Prior to the announcement, Reuters reported that Manfred Weber, president of the EPP, the largest party in the European Parliament, said the EU was planning to scrap the ban and indicated that he supported the new plan.\n\n\"The European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines. ... It was a serious industrial policy mistake,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement is a blow for the EU's green credentials. The bloc is legally obligated to become carbon-neutral by 2050. Cars and vans are responsible for around 15% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions, so a phase-out of polluting vehicles was a key part of EU climate policy.\n\nThe new measures are likely a concession to the European auto industry, which is under pressure from high energy costs and tariffs on exports to the United States.\n\nCar manufacturers had high hopes for the shift toward electric vehicles when ambitious targets were originally set, but they have had to grapple with fierce competition from China and lower-than-expected consumer demand for EVs. Meanwhile, the charging infrastructure is not uniform throughout the continent.\n\nTim Dexter, a policy manager for environmental advocacy group T&E, said in a statement that the dilution of the ban could have \"significant consequences for the climate.\" It would send \"a signal that long-term commitments can be rolled back just as they start to deliver real emissions cuts,\" he added.\n\nThe news comes after Ford announced that it was pulling back on its EV plans, a move that will result in a $19.5 billion charge against its earnings.\n\nFord and US other automakers invested heavily in EV plans in anticipation of stringent environmental regulations put in place during the Biden administration. But the Trump administration has rolled back those emissions rules along with financial support for EVs, and is challenging states' authority to set tougher rules.\n\nMeasuring how much planet-warming pollution a car emits is not a straightforward science as its whole life cycle, including how it was manufactured, needs to be taken into account.\n\nGas-powered cars, hybrids and EVs all emit roughly the same amount of pollution to manufacture, until you get to producing the battery.\n\nFully electric cars use large batteries made of materials that require heavy mining. That makes EVs 40% dirtier to produce on average than hybrid and gas-powered vehicles, one study shows.\n\nBut the picture changes over their whole life cycle. Gas-powered cars are the cleanest to make, but are the dirtiest over their lifetimes because their tailpipe pollution is so high. EVs might be the most carbon-intensive to manufacture, but they emit the least carbon pollution over their lifetimes: 40% less than gas-powered cars.\n\nCNN's Chris Isidore, Ivana Kottasov\u00e1, Angela Dewan, Ella Nilsen and Lou Robinson contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

      "title": "Auto future takes an unexpected turn, as gas cars get a new boost",
      "body": "Brussels -- The gasoline-powered car is outlasting the policies that had aimed to banish it.\n\nThe latest example of the combustion engine's staying power came Tuesday, when the European Union said it would back away from a landmark pledge to ban emissions from new vehicles in 2035. That announcement came one day after Ford Motor Co. said it would scale back electric vehicle production plans, joining a long list of American and European automakers to rethink climate strategies.\n\nThose retreats, taken together, show that the full-on electric transition is far less certain than it might have looked several years ago -- and that polluting cars and trucks could remain on roads across Europe and America for decades to come. The moves also sharpen the contrast between the West and China, which has developed a massive and lucrative EV market supplied by state-backed automakers.\n\nIn the United States, where President Donald Trump has portrayed electric cars as an expensive \"scam,\" the White House has cut EV incentives and this month announced plans to weaken fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks.\n\nEuropean officials say they favor a future that is mostly electric, and many countries still have EV incentives in place. But Brussels faced intense pressure from the continent's automakers to dilute the 2035 ban. Those legacy carmakers, with huge workforces and factories built around combustion engines, have struggled to compete with China's low-cost, high-quality EVs.\n\nThe revised proposal will force carmakers to meet 90% fleetwide emissions reductions compared with 2021 levels. That means most vehicles will be fully electric. But it also leaves room for hybrids -- including those with a plug-in option -- and gas-powered vehicles.\n\nFerdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, the director of the Center Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany, said he sees the world's auto industry splitting into three parts -- one in the United States, fully supportive of gas cars; one in China, all in on EVs; and another in Europe, where policies are now muddled. He said Chinese automakers are likely to benefit most from that dynamic because the Chinese market dwarfs those in the United States and Europe and looks to keep growing -- and electrifying.\n\nAmerican and European markets have had a hard time splitting from the gas-powered vehicles because combustion engines have higher profit margins. But that strategy leaves them in a long-term bind.\n\n\"In the future, China will define the rules of the car industry,\" Dudenh\u00f6ffer said.\n\nWith a license to keep producing gas vehicles, he said, Western manufacturers \"earn some kind of short-term windfall. But in the long term, they lose a lot. The advantages of the Chinese carmakers will be larger and larger.\"\n\nFord, in its announcement, said it was seeking out \"higher-return opportunities\" by expanding gas and hybrid options. It said it would produce a gas-powered pickup truck at a Tennessee plant while ending production of its flagship EV, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nCarmakers such as Volvo Cars and Porsche AG have also pulled back from more ambitious EV plans. Earlier this year, Stellantis NV, which includes the Jeep and Fiat brands, shifted away from plans to be fully electric in Europe by 2030.\n\nThe gas vehicle ban had been a core component of Europe's much-heralded climate plan, introduced four years ago as officials cited the \"generational task\" of saving the planet. At the time, EU leaders said they had put the continent's car industry -- which accounts for 7% of Europe's gross domestic product -- at the forefront of innovation by creating a clear future target.\n\nBut large automakers -- including Mercedes-Benz AG, Volkswagen AG and BMW AG -- have seen their market values nosedive. In a strategic error, the EVs they produced tended to be high-end, not for the mass market. In the meantime, leaders in Germany and Italy described the 2035 target as a danger to European jobs.\n\n\"Such a hard cutoff in 2035 will not take place, if I have anything to do with it,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said.",

      "title": "Europe May Roll Back Combustion Engine Ban",
      "body": "The combustion engine may be given another reprieve.\n\nEuropean Union officials introduced a proposal on Tuesday to revise a wide-ranging ban on the production of gasoline- and diesel-powered cars by 2035. The move came after intense lobbying by Europe's automobile industry, which has been confronting declining sales in China, plunging profits and job losses.\n\nInstead of requiring European manufacturers to produce cars with zero carbon emissions by 2035, the new proposal would require a 90 percent reduction in emissions. The plan, if approved, would mean that hybrids and internal-combustion-engine vehicles could still be made after the deadline.\n\nGermany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has been leading the campaign to ease the rules on combustion engine cars, which produce carbon emissions. Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria have also pushed for the rules to be revised.\n\nPremium carmakers like Porsche, Mercedes and BMW would most likely benefit the most, said Matthias Schmidt, a European auto industry analyst.\n\n\"They've struggled with the transition to electric mobility,\" he said. \"They couldn't place as much high value on their electric vehicles as they could on their internal-combustion-engine vehicles.\"\n\nElectric vehicles from premier brands have attracted some buyers. But their customer base is more interested in the traditional mechanics of the car, Mr. Schmidt said, just as aficionados of luxury Swiss watches are attracted to mechanical and not digital models. With top-tier cars, the combustion engine has the allure.\n\nMass market automakers like Volkswagen and Stellantis might pivot to electric vehicles faster, partly because of competition from Chinese brands, Mr. Schmidt said.\n\nThe proposal from the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, requires that emissions be offset through the use of low-carbon steel produced within the bloc or from e-fuels and biofuels. It also includes new incentives for compact European-made electric cars.\n\nThe commission said that it would also cut red tape to save the auto industry 706 million euros ($833 million) a year.\n\nThe revision is part of a wider rollback of regulations and policies intended to slow the effects of global warming. Much of the reversal has been spearheaded by President Trump, who has called climate change a \"con job\" and strongly supported the fossil fuel industry.\n\nIn October, the Trump administration eliminated tax credits for electric cars. And this month, it weakened fuel efficiency requirements for tens of millions of new cars and light trucks.\n\nOn Monday, Ford Motor said it was scrapping plans to produce electric vehicles and reduced its profit outlook by $19.5 billion to account for the change. General Motors and Stellantis have also recently switched their focus from electric vehicles to combustion engines and hybrids.\n\nThe European Union has long been a leader in promoting the green transition. The 2035 ban, passed two years ago, was considered a pillar of the bloc's plan to become carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nBut officials in Europe have also become increasingly concerned about the region's competitiveness and have sought to reduce or water down many regulations.\n\nIn February, for example, the commission proposed to substantially loosen requirements that companies report on the social and environmental effects of their operations. And last month, Brussels proposed cutting the disclosure requirements on sustainable financial products.\n\nSharp competition from Chinese automakers combined with steep U.S. tariffs have hammered Europe's automobile industry. The German Association of the Automotive Industry has said that 70 percent of jobs in the country's auto industry are linked to exports.\n\n\"China is aggressively competing in key technologies including E.V.s and batteries,\" Wopke Hoekstra, the E.U. climate commissioner, said on Tuesday, \"while the U.S. continues to outpace us in productivity and innovation in at least a number of sectors.\"\n\nChinese firms like BYD are setting up factories in Hungary and Turkey, while Chinese battery makers are putting factories in Morocco to supply European carmakers and avoid tariffs.\n\nMr. Hoekstra added that the European car industry was \"fighting for survival\" and that \"we are stepping in to ensure a successful clean future for the industry.\"\n\nAutomakers have additionally argued that the public has not yet embraced the switch to electric vehicles and that governments have been slow to provide sufficient charging stations.\n\nCritics blasted the retreat on climate goals. \"Every euro diverted into plug-in hybrids is a euro not spent on E.V.s while China races further ahead,\" said William Todts, executive director of Transport & Environment, an advocacy group. \"Clinging to combustion engines won't make European automakers great again.\"\n\nTransportation still accounts for more than a fourth of the European Union's total greenhouse gas emissions. The level has remained unchanged over the last 30 years.\n\nOther companies connected to the electric vehicle industry have also opposed changes in the law. This fall, more than 150 chief executives from firms including Volvo and Polestar sent an open letter to the European Commission reiterating their support for the 2035 ban.\n\nGovernments in Spain and France have also voiced their endorsement of the current deadline.\n\nChanging the ban would require the approval of the bloc's 27 members and the European Parliament.\n\nSomini Sengupta contributed reporting from New York.\n\nPatricia Cohen writes about global economics for The Times and is based in London.",

      "body": "The EU has confirmed it wants to water down its landmark 2035 ban on the sale of new petrol or diesel cars, yielding to heavy pressure from the car industry and leaders from several EU member states including Germany and Italy.\n\nWopke Hoekstra, a European climate commissioner, described the proposals as a \"win, win\" situation for consumers and industry, keeping Europe on the electrification course with a series of carrot and stick measures.\n\nUnder current legislation, manufacturers were obliged to ensure that 100% of production of cars and vans had zero emissions up to 2035.\n\nThe European Commission has now proposed reducing this to 90%, enabling the continued manufacture of a portion of plug-in hybrid electric cars, or even combustion engines beyond 2035.\n\nIn a carrot-and-stick approach, the remaining 10% of assembly line output that is not carbon neutral will need to be compensated by other green measures on the factory floor, including the use of green steel made in Europe or use of biofuels in non-electric vehicles.\n\n\"This will allow for plug-in hybrids (PHEV), range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal combustion engine vehicles to still play a role beyond 2035, in addition to full electric (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles,\" the commission said.\n\nApostolos Tzitzikostas, a commissioner for sustainable transport, said: \"This gives the market and the consumer the freedom to decide which technology they want to drive.\" The industry commissioner, St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, said the European industry faced three challenges: competition from China, \"a crisis in demand\" and slow tech development in Europe.\n\nThe proposals, which require approval from EU governments and the European parliament, are the bloc's biggest retreat from its green policies enacted over the previous five years.\n\nOpponents said the announcement was a blow for Europe's electrification journey.\n\nChris Heron, the secretary general of E-Mobility Europe, said it was \"the wrong time for Europe to take the wind out of its own sails\", adding the only way the EU industry could remain competitive was to reinforce its policy, not by \"pulling off course\".\n\nGreenpeace UK's policy director, Dr Douglas Parr, urged Keir Starmer not to follow suit. \"The UK must not join Europe in this act of economic self-sabotage,\" he said.\n\nGreenpeace Germany's executive director, Martin Kaiser, described the plan as \"an early Christmas present for Chinese electric car manufacturers\".\n\nAnnouncing the proposals, Hoekstra insisted the EU was \"staying the course on zero emissions\" but \"introducing some flexibility for manufacturers so they can meet their CO2 two targets in the most cost efficient way\".\n\nS\u00e9journ\u00e9 also announced measures to accelerate the delivery of small electric cars.\n\nIf the vehicles are under 4.2m in length, cost between \u20ac15,000 to \u20ac20,000 (\u00a313,151 to \u00a317,535) and are made in the EU, customers will benefit from reductions in road tolls and discounts at charging stations and manufacturers will get bonus credits for their factory floor carbon output.\n\nUp to 2035, manufacturers of small electric cars will get \"super credits\" allowing them to bank bonus carbon credits for their factories.\n\nBEUC, the EU organisation of consumer bodies, welcomed efforts to bring small EVs to the market, saying hybrid cars at a cost of \u20ac40,000 were \"nowhere near a real option for most households\".\n\nThe commission is also proposing to relax targets for electric vans, reducing the requirements for a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 to 40%.\n\nThe move, which follows lobbying by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will be seen as a victory for the European car industry, which has struggled to make the transition to electric and faces growing competition from Chinese rivals.\n\nThe decision, which had been widely anticipated in recent days, has already been denounced by the Green party in the European parliament, which has said it amounts to a \"gutting\" of flagship legislation aimed at cutting Europe's emissions.\n\nThe commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who championed the green deal, insisted that \"Europe remains at the forefront of the global clean transition\".\n\nShe said the proposals, which must be supported by the European parliament, were taken after \"intense dialogues with automotive sector, civil society organisations and stakeholders\".",

Previous plans would have meant that carmakers could only sell electric or hydrogen vehicles, whereas the new decision means that they're free to sell all types of hybrids, as well as standard petrol and diesel models.\n\nInstead, from 2035, carmakers will need to meet a 90 per cent tailpipe emissions reduction target while the remaining 10 per cent 'will need to be compensated through the use of low-carbon steel Made in the Union, or from e-fuels and biofuels.'\n\nIt still means that the vast majority of cars sold by manufacturers will need to be electric or low-emissions, with the final 10 per cent being 'traditional' internal combustion-engined models.\n\nHowever, the EU states that the new rules will allow 'plug-in hybrids (PHEV), range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal combustion engine vehicles to still play a role beyond 2035, in addition to full electric (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles.'\n\nManufacturers will also be able to generate 'super credits' through small electric vehicles measuring under 4.3 metres in length. Each will count as 1.3 vehicles against manufacturing numbers. The EU says this feature will also allow manufacturers to 'bank' credits to help with future production.\n\nPresident von der Leyen said: \"Innovation. Clean mobility. Competitiveness. This year, these were top priorities in our intense dialogues with the automotive sector, civil society organisations and stakeholders.\n\n\"And today, we are addressing them all together. As technology rapidly transforms mobility and geopolitics reshapes global competition, Europe remains at the forefront of the global clean transition.\"\n\nAt present, it isn't clear what impact this will have on the UK's own plans, which currently lead towards a 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.",

The decision has elicited mixed reactions across Europe, balancing tradition with electric innovation amid global competitiveness concerns.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission unveiled proposals reversing the effective ban on new internal combustion engine car sales set for 2035. This came following pressure from Germany, Italy, and major car manufacturers. The new package aims for a 90% reduction in tailpipe emissions compared to 2021 levels and includes measures to expedite electric vehicle transition.\n\nThe decision stirred diverse reactions. Steffen Kawohl of the German Mittelstand Association suggests the transition only slows but does not halt entirely, offering time to advance fossil-free mobility. However, Dominic Phinn from the Climate Group criticized it as a backward move, hindering progress despite European companies' significant investments in electric fleets.\n\nVolvo Cars and Chris Heron of E-Mobility Europe express concerns that reopening doors to plug-in hybrids and biofuels undermines Europe's competitive edge in the global race for electric transport.

Sejourne stressed that France had not lost out, noting the 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in interest-free loans to European battery makers announced as part of the commission's new measures.",

It introduces measures to hasten the shift to electric vehicles while allowing automakers greater flexibility. Automakers can still sell plug-in hybrids beyond 2035 and utilize CO2-neutral fuels, including advanced biofuels from waste, to meet emission targets.\n\nCorporate fleets, accounting for 60% of new car sales in Europe, will adhere to binding electrification goals linked to GDP, with exemptions for smaller enterprises.

      "body": "The European Commission is expected tomorrow to roll back the EU's effective ban on the sale of new combustion-engine cars from 2035, amid strong pressure from Germany, Italy and European carmakers facing stiff competition from Chinese and US rivals.\n\nThe change, with details still being finalised by EU officials ahead of its announcement, could see the ban delayed by five years or diluted indefinitely, according to official and industry sources, reports RTE.\n\nSuch a revision to the 2023 law requiring all new cars and vans sold across the 27-member bloc from 2035 to be CO2 emission-free would mark the European Union's biggest retreat from its green agenda in the past five years.\n\n\"The European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,\" said Manfred Weber, leader of the European Parliament's largest grouping, the European People's Party. \"It was a serious industrial policy mistake\", reports RTE.\n\nThe prospect of scrapping the ban has split the automotive sector. Established manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Fiat-owner Stellantis have lobbied strongly for looser targets, citing intense competition from cheaper Chinese rivals. However, companies focused on electric vehicles argue this would hand China an even greater advantage in the shift to electrification.\n\n\"The technology is ready, charging infrastructure is ready, and consumers are ready,\" said Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller. \"So what are we waiting for?\", reports RTE.\n\nThe 2023 legislation was intended to speed up the transition away from combustion engines towards battery or fuel-cell vehicles, with penalties for automakers that failed to meet emissions targets.\n\nComplying with those targets requires higher sales of electric vehicles, an area where European manufacturers trail behind Tesla and Chinese firms such as BYD and Geely, reports RTE.\n\nEuropean carmakers are producing EVs but say demand has fallen short of expectations, with consumers hesitant due to higher costs and limited charging infrastructure. Tariffs imposed by the EU on Chinese-made EVs have only marginally eased competitive pressure.\n\n\"It's not a sustainable reality today in Europe,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told reporters in France last week, as he announced a partnership with Renault aimed at cutting EV costs. He said industry needs were \"not well balanced\" with EU CO2 targets, reports RTE.\n\nIn March, the EU gave the car industry some \"breathing space\" by allowing manufacturers to meet 2025 emissions targets over a three-year period.\n\nHowever, automakers want continued permission to sell combustion-engine vehicles alongside plug-in hybrids, range-extender EVs and vehicles running on so-called CO2-neutral fuels, including biofuels made from agricultural waste and used cooking oil, reports RTE.\n\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen said in October that she was open to the use of e-fuels and \"advanced biofuels\".\n\n\"We recommend a multi-technology approach,\" said Todd Anderson, chief technology officer at combustion-engine fuel systems firm Phinia, adding that the internal combustion engine will \"be around for the rest of the century\", reports RTE.\n\nThe electric vehicle industry, meanwhile, warns that weakening the ban would damage investment and push the EU even further behind China.\n\n\"It's definitely going to have an effect,\" said Rick Wilmer, CEO of charging hardware and software company ChargePoint, reports RTE.\n\nAutomakers are also seeking changes to the 2030 target requiring a 55% reduction in car emissions, calling for it to be phased in over several years, and want the 50% reduction target for vans scrapped. Germany has argued that sustainable practices such as using low-carbon steel should count towards emissions reductions.\n\nThe European Commission is also expected to outline measures to increase the share of EVs in corporate fleets, particularly company cars, which account for around 60% of new car sales in Europe, reports RTE.\n\nThe auto industry has called for incentives rather than mandatory targets, citing Belgium as an example where subsidies have proven effective.\n\nThe Commission is likely to propose creating a new regulatory category for small electric vehicles, which would benefit from lower taxes and earn additional credits towards meeting CO2 targets, reports RTE.\n\nEnvironmental groups argue the EU should stick with its 2035 deadline, saying biofuels are scarce, not genuinely CO2-neutral and too costly to scale.\n\n\"Europe needs to stay the course on electric,\" said William Todts, executive director of clean transport advocacy group T&E. \"It's clear electric is the future\", reports RTE.\n\nTell us your thoughts in the Facebook post and share this with your friends.",

      "body": "\"The European Commission has chosen an approach that is both pragmatic and consistent with its climate objectives and ambitions,\" Stephane Sejourne told AFP in an interview at the EU parliament.\n\nHeeding calls from industry, the European Commission agreed to give ground on one of its flagship climate measures by relaxing the planned ban on new combustion-engine car sales.\n\nInstead of a full switch to electric vehicles, Brussels will let carmakers use \"other types of technologies\" for a limited part of their sales beyond 2035, Sejourne said.\n\nAdopted under commission chief Ursula von der Leyen's first term, the combustion-engine ban was a key part of the EU's pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\n\"The goal remains the same,\" said the commission vice president. \"But the flexibilities are pragmatic given consumer uptake and the difficulty for manufacturers to offer 100 percent electric by 2035.\"\n\nFaced with competition from China and trade tensions with the United States, the EU has delayed or pared back a series of green measures in a pro-business shift over the past year.\n\nSejourne back in March warned that Europe's car industry was in \"mortal danger\" as the EU launched a rescue plan for the sector, with rivals speeding ahead in the United States and China.\n\nThe jewel in Europe's industrial crown, the auto industry employs almost 14 million people and contributes some seven percent to the European Union's economy -- but faces rising threats.\n\nSejourne rejected the charge from environmentalists that the concessions granted to automakers undermine Europe's climate goals.\n\n\"The electric transition remains the objective, but these flexibilities are pragmatic in the current context,\" he told AFP in Tuesday's interview.\n\nGermany and Poland had pushed hard for a rollback of the 2035 ban and the right to keep selling combustion engine cars beyond 2035.\n\nFrance was more cautious, fearing the move could stifle Europe's emerging electric battery sector.\n\nSejourne stressed that France had not lost out, noting the 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in interest-free loans to European battery makers announced as part of the commission's new measures.",

This decision garners mixed reactions focusing on economic impacts, electric mobility, and regulatory trust.\n\nAmid mounting pressure from Germany, Italy, and major automakers, the European Commission made public new proposals on Tuesday that backtrack on the previously planned effective ban on new internal combustion engine cars from 2035. Instead, the commission aims for a 90% reduction in tailpipe emissions compared to 2021 and introduces measures to bolster the shift to electric vehicles.\n\nSteffen Kawohl, a policy advisor at the German Mittelstand Association, remarked that removing the ban could decelerate the automotive industry's transformation but emphasized that the German economy must capitalize on this additional time to further the transition to fossil-free mobility. On the other hand, Chris Heron, Secretary General of E-Mobility Europe, criticized the decision, warning that it might hinder Europe's momentum in the growing electric car market.\n\nVolkswagen expressed support for the commission's pragmatic approach, highlighting the special support for small electric vehicles and greater flexibility in CO2 targets for both passenger and light commercial vehicles.

      "body": "The European Union has dropped its plan to force car manufacturers to switch to all-electric cars by 2035, which was one of the main measures to protect the environment, given the crisis the sector is experiencing in Europe.\n\nHere are the main measures from the plan to support the automotive sector, announced today in Strasbourg by the European Commission:\n\nRevised and adjusted decarbonization trajectory\n\nThe ban on the sale of new cars with internal combustion engines (petrol or diesel) or hybrids, which was to come into force in 2035, is being replaced by new decarbonization targets for car manufacturers.\n\nUnder the Commission's proposals, they will be able to continue selling cars using all available technologies, including internal combustion engines or hybrids, but to a limited extent.\n\nThey will have to comply with a number of strict conditions designed to ensure, as originally envisaged, 100% decarbonization of the European fleet of new cars by 2035:\n\n- manufacturers will have to reduce CO2 emissions from their new cars by at least 90% compared to 2021 levels;\n\n- the remaining 10% of emissions must be fully offset in advance through a credit system;\n\n- manufacturers will be able to acquire these credits by using low-carbon steel \"produced in Europe\" and renewable or sustainable fuels (synthetic fuels or biofuels).\n\nEco-friendliness targets for commercial fleets\n\nThe decarbonization targets for commercial fleets, which represent a very large part of the new car market in Europe, will be set at the level of individual Member States to support the demand for 100% electric or low-CO2 cars.\n\nThey will apply to companies with more than 250 employees or \u20ac50 million in turnover, including car rental companies, which represent a significant market.\n\nBrussels will grant \u20ac1.5 billion in interest-free loans to the European electric vehicle battery industry, which is a key element of the sector's decarbonisation, as part of a special action plan.\n\nThe EU will support in various ways the development of a new category of small electric vehicles, called \"M1e,\" to respond to competition from China:\n\n- these will be cars less than 4.2 m long;\n\n- Brussels will ensure that the introduction of new regulatory requirements for these vehicles is kept to a minimum for 10 years;\n\n- vehicles of this type manufactured in Europe will enable their manufacturers to obtain \"super credits,\" additional credits for achieving their CO2 emission targets;\n\n- In addition, the Commission will recommend that countries introduce national incentives, such as purchase bonuses.\n\nThe European Commission wants to encourage European equipment manufacturers, suppliers, and subcontractors by introducing \"European preference\" in the automotive industry, i.e., local content requirements in the production chains of manufacturers that benefit from public funding.\n\nEmissions credits linked to low-carbon steel produced in Europe, as well as measures to support the battery sector, contribute to this approach.\n\nA text called the \"industrial accelerator,\" expected at the end of January, should also include measures in this direction.\n\nThe EU will also review the electrification obligations imposed on manufacturers of light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. The latter have warned that they risk facing very heavy fines from 2030 onwards due to insufficient demand for electric models. | BGNES, AFP",

The EU executive revoked the 2035 ban on the sale of new cars and vans powered by diesel or petrol after pressure from some EU countries and the automotive industry.\n\nEuropean Union-based carmakers will need to comply with a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions from 2035, instead of the 100% previously set in EU law, the European Commission announced today, revoking a controversial wholesale ban on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles adopted in March 2023.\n\nManufacturers will have to compensate for the remaining 10% of emissions by using low-carbon steel produced in the EU or by using sustainable fuels such as e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nThe industry will be allowed to continue producing plug-in hybrids, range extenders, mild hybrids, and ICE vehicles beyond 2035.\n\nFull electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles will also be encouraged, with car manufacturers eligible to receive \"super credits\" for producing small, affordable electric cars made in the EU27, the Commission said.\n\n\"We're staying the course towards zero-emissions mobility, but introducing some flexibilities for manufacturers to meet their CO2 targets in the most cost-efficient way,\" Climate Action Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe new automotive package is a \"win-win\", Hoekstra said, noting that carmakers will have more flexibility while creating a lead market for clean steel.\n\nTransport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas hailed the \"great decision\" to reduce the 2035 target to 90%.\n\n\"This is a clear signal that other technologies than battery electric vehicles can be put on the market after 2035,\" Tzitzikostas added, noting the consumers will have the freedom to decide which technology they want to drive.\n\nDespite some calls within the automotive sector to keep the ban and invest more in electrification, the vast majority of car manufacturers have been urging the EU to rethink its policies, claiming that their businesses are dying in the face of competition from China and the United States.\n\nGermany, Italy, and several other member states have also lobbied the EU executive to withdraw the ban, arguing that the social fabric of their economies, propped up by the automotive industry, is disappearing. They claim their automakers are struggling with high energy prices, a shortage of car components, including batteries, and insufficient consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nGerman automotive giant Volkswagen is expected to stop manufacturing vehicles at its site in Dresden, marking the first time in the carmaker's 88-year history that it will close production in Germany, according to recent media reports.\n\nBulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Slovakia were among the EU countries that asked the Commission to reconsider the 2035 ICE ban and to consider the sale of hybrid vehicles under the law.\n\nFrance and Spain wanted to keep the ban, but asked the EU executive to support domestic production.\n\nVeteran lawmaker Peter Liese of the European People's Party (EPP) welcomed the EU executive's update, saying that technological neutrality and climate neutrality \"are compatible and must be reconciled\".\n\n\"The future belongs to electromobility, and I believe that too. We mustn't slacken our support for electromobility, especially when it comes to expanding the charging infrastructure,\" said Liese.\n\nSigfried de Vries, secretary-general at the automotive lobby group European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, said that \"flexibility was urgent\" but maintained the sector's commitment to decarbonisation.\n\n\"Auto makers have invested hundreds of billions of euros and put over 300 electrified models on the market. There cannot be any question about their commitment,\" said De Vries.\n\nDe Vries welcomed the Commission's flexibility to enable compliance with CO2 reduction targets in the run-up to 2030 and technological neutrality beyond 2035.\n\nChris Heron, secretary general of E-mobility Europe, a trade association lobbying for electric mobility, regretted the Commission's decision, saying it will create more uncertainty for investors.\n\n\"We know the future of transport is electric,\" he said. \"What isn't settled is who will build it. Hesitation or mixed signals risk undermining the investment certainty battery makers, manufacturers and grids need to scale. The message for policymakers is simple: hold the line on ambition and give industry clarity.\"\n\nThe decision to ban the sale of new ICE cars and vans by 2035 was part of the European Green Deal, the EU's flagship programme to reach climate neutrality by 2050, which drove Ursula von der Leyen's first mandate as Commission President between 2019 and 2023.\n\nBut the winds changed with the EU elections in 2024. Green lawmakers in the European Parliament suffered a significant blow, and the chamber became dominated by the centre-right EPP and the far-right, with new parties like Patriots for Europe and the Europe of Sovereign Nations increasingly influencing policymaking.\n\nGerman lawmaker Manfred Weber, the EPP's leader, has been among the many centrists opposed to the 2035 ICE ban, claiming it was too early tor the industry to adjust to the transition.\n\nWeber recently told the German media that the EU's intention to open up the law would send an important signal \"to the entire automotive industry and secures tens of thousands of industrial jobs\".\n\nLars Aagaard, the Danish minister for climate, energy and utilities acting on behalf of the Danish EU Presidency, said the review of the ICE ban on cars and vans needs to be aligned with the 2040 climate target.\n\n\"We will analyse the proposal from the Commission. Then I'm looking forward to being a Dane again and we will look into what our position will be,\" Aagaard said on Monday on the sidelines of the Environment Council.\n\nThe Commission proposal will now be negotiated between the European Parliament and the European Council. The incoming EU Cypriot Presidency will mediate political negotiations starting in January 2026.",

      "body": "From 2035, 10 per cent of car sales in the EU can comprise hybrid, plug-in hybrid or even standard petrol and diesel cars\n\nThe EU has made the monumental decision to scrap its 2035 ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars in a move that has sent a seismic wave through the car industry - one that will certainly have an impact on the UK's own EV transition.\n\nIn a statement on 16 December 2026, the European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, Wopke Hoekstra said: \"We want our industries to be the leaders of the transition to a low-carbon economy because that is what is best for our climate, competitiveness and independence.\"\n\n\"Today, we are stepping in to ensure a successful clean future for the automotive sector,\" they continued. \"We are introducing flexibilities for manufacturers, and in turn this will have to be compensated with low-carbon steel and the use of sustainable fuels to drive down emissions.\"\n\nPetrol and diesel ban plan scrapped: what does it mean in practice?\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, while the previous plan saw only pure-electric and hydrogen cars allowed to be sold from new in the EU after 2035, the new revision enables manufacturers to consider selling plug-in, full and mild-hybrid, as well as old-school internal combustion petrol and diesel models past this date.\n\nThe catch is that these types of vehicle can only account for 10 per cent of sales; manufacturers will be required to offset the emissions from these cars by utilising low-carbon steel during manufacturing, or by powering their cars with e-fuels and biofuels.\n\nFurthermore, in the lead up to 2035 manufacturers will be able to make use of so-called 'super credits' for small electric cars; these models (measuring under 4.3 metres in length) will each count as 1.3 vehicles against manufacturing quotas, enabling manufacturers to effectively 'bank' progress towards emissions targets.",

      "body": "The European Commission proposed on Tuesday dropping the EU's effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035 by allowing continued sales of some non-electric vehicles following intense pressure from Germany, Italy and Europe's auto sector.\n\nThe EU executive appears to have bowed to calls from carmakers to keep selling plug-in hybrids and range extenders that burn fuel as they struggle to compete against Tesla TSLA.O and Chinese electric vehicle makers.\n\nCurrent EU rules require all new cars and vans from 2035 to have zero emissions. Under Tuesday's proposal, the target would shift to a 90 per cent cut in CO2 emissions from 2021 levels, instead of 100 per cent.\n\nAutomakers would need to offset the remaining emissions by using lower-carbon steel made in the EU and synthetic e-fuels or non-food biofuels such as agricultural waste and used cooking oil.\n\nThe plan also gives automakers a three-year window from 2030 to 2032 to cut car CO2 emissions by 55 per cent from 2021 levels, while the 2030 target for vans would be eased to 40 per cent from 50 per cent.\n\nEU CLIMATE CLIMB-DOWN AS FORD SCRAPS EVS\n\nThe moves, which require approval from EU governments and the European Parliament, mark the bloc's biggest retreat from its green policies enacted over the previous five years.\n\nIt follows Ford Motor F.Nannouncing on Monday a $19.5 billion writedown as it axes several EV models, in response to the Trump administration's policies and weakening EV demand.\n\nEuropean carmakers including Volkswagen VOWG.DE and Fiat owner Stellantis STLAM.MI have also flagged soft EV demand and urged looser targets and lower fines for missing them. Automotive lobby ACEA called the moment \"high noon\" for the sector.\n\nGerman manufacturers are under particular strain as they lose ground in China to local rivals and face growing competition at home from Chinese EV imports. EU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs have offered only limited relief.\n\nEU LAGGING CHINA IN EV RACE\n\nThe EV industry warned that easing emissions targets could undermine investment and leave Europe falling further behind China in the shift to cleaner driving.\n\n\"Moving from a clear 100 per cent zero-emissions target to 90 per cent may seem small, but if we backtrack now, we won't just hurt the climate. We'll hurt Europe's ability to compete,\" said Michael Lohscheller, CEO of Swedish EV manufacturer Polestar.\n\nWilliam Todts, executive director of clean transport advocacy group T&E, said the EU was playing for time while China was racing ahead.\n\n\"Clinging to combustion engines won't make European automakers great again,\" he said.\n\nThe Commission also outlined plans to boost EV uptake in corporate fleets, which account for about 60% of new car sales in Europe.

      "body": "European Commission pushes made-in-Europe ambition with regulatory tweaks\n\nThe European Commission has pulled a sharp U-turn, offering a reprieve to combustion-engine cars with a proposal to roll back a zero-emissions standard set to apply to new vehicles from 2035.\n\nInstead, the exhaust-pipe CO2 emissions limit will only be cut by 90% from the reference level. As it applies to the average for all vehicles sold by a manufacturer, it will be able to continue selling a number of conventional models alongside all-electric cars.\n\nManufacturers will also be allowed to continue marketing plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles with small combustion engines to extend their range.\n\nAll this, however, is on condition that they will compensate the remaining 10 percentage points by using climate-friendlier made-in-Europe green steel, while factoring in how much sustainable renewable fuel their new cars will use, based on market availability of the low-carbon alternatives to petrol and diesel.\n\nThe emissions associated with renewable fuels will depend on how much biofuel and synthetic fuel derived from hydrogen and CO2, known as e-fuels, are available on the market, a Commission official explained.\n\n\"All potential further emissions generated have to be fully offset upstream,\" Commission vice-president St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 told reporters in Brussels.\n\nIf carmakers don't compensate for their residual emissions, they will face the same hefty fines currently foreseen in the CO2 standards regulation.\n\nThe move marks a major win for EU carmakers, conservative political parties and governments on the right of the political spectrum, who lobbied hard against the EU's clean car mandate, arguing that this would kill a struggling industry responsible for 2.5 million jobs and 7.5% of the bloc's GDP.\n\nWhile giving in to this major industrial and political pressure, the European Commission is also offering carmakers extra flexibility to meet intermediate emission reduction goals between 2030 and 2033, allowing them to bank and borrow fleet CO2 reductions from one year to another.\n\nThe new people's car\n\nAs previously reported by Euractiv, the Commission also proposed to incentivise sales of a new category of small, affordable electric cars by granting extra emissions reduction credits that will ease compliance with the gradually tightening CO2 limits.\n\nIn practice, each small (no more than 4.2 metres in length) electric car will count as 1.3 cars for the purposes of total fleet emissions, thereby reducing the overall average.\n\nThe small cars, as envisaged by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, will also have to be \"made in Europe\" - although precisely what that means will be decided only next year in an upcoming law dedicated to the acceleration of Europe's industrial decarbonisation.\n\nVans are also targeted. In response to a slow uptake of electric models, the Commission has lowered the emission reductions goal that this segment must achieve in 2030 from 50% to 40%. It has also exempted electric vans from strict speed-limiting and driving-time monitoring devices when they exceed a 3.5-tonne limit due to the extra weight of batteries, a measure intended to attract commercial buyers.\n\nCorporate fleets national mandates\n\nIn a separate piece of legislation, the Commission proposed rules to make corporate fleets, such as delivery vans, greener. The new rules will affect only companies with over 250 employees and a turnover over \u20ac50 million, but the EU mandates will apply only at the country level.\n\nThis means that each EU government will be responsible for reaching individual national targets for the uptake of low-emissions models, likely by offering tax advantages to low- and zero-emission cars and vans.\n\nA third piece of legislation will try to slash red tape and compliance costs for manufacturers, namely by cutting back plans for new implementation rules and simplifying the testing regimes for new vans and trucks.\n\nAccording to the Commission, this latest \"omnibus\" simplification proposal should allow manufacturers to save some \u20ac706 million per year.\n\nTo complete its automotive package, the Commission also unveiled a plan to reduce dependency on China for battery supplies by boosting local production, with \u20ac1.5 billion in interest-free loans on offer to European producers.\n\nThe proposals are now in the hands of the European Parliament and national governments in the Council of the EU, which can amend the rules before negotiating a final legal text.",

      "title": "EU Halts 2035 ICE Ban; South Korea Accelerates EV Push",
      "body": "EU Admits Policy Errors as South Korea's 2035 EV Target Risks Automakers\n\nThe EU's decision to withdraw the \"2035 ban on internal combustion engine vehicle sales,\" once a global symbol of carbon neutrality, stems from a stark realization: reckless electrification risks collapsing the automotive industry. Meanwhile, the South Korean government is accelerating in the opposite direction, deepening the crisis for domestic automakers.\n\nWhen the law passed the European Parliament in February 2023, major European automakers like Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz announced large-scale investments to transition to electric vehicles (EVs). However, they proved no match for Chinese rivals, which had grown for over a decade on state support and domestic demand. European firms lost market share in their home region to Chinese brands and saw profits plummet in China, where they previously accounted for over one-third of sales.\n\nThe most shocking signal came from Volkswagen, Germany's automotive pride. The Volkswagen Group reported a \u20ac1.072 billion (approx. 1.9 trillion Korean won) loss in the third quarter alone -- its first quarterly deficit in five years. On the 16th, it announced the closure of a domestic German factory, a drastic move unheard of in its 88-year history.\n\nChinese EVs flooding the European market delivered the final blow. Chinese EV brands' market share in Europe surged from 7% in early 2023 to 11.8% in October. The EU has since admitted, \"Environmental policies ignoring industrial realities are own goals,\" and begun revising its approach.\n\nThe U.S. also pivoted sharply toward internal combustion engines with the start of \"Trump's second term.\" In October, it abolished $7,500 EV subsidies per vehicle, and earlier this month, relaxed fuel efficiency regulations -- a legacy of the Biden administration aimed at boosting EV production. Major automakers like Ford and GM swiftly followed, scrapping EV investment plans.\n\nSouth Korea, however, is racing in the opposite direction. Last month, the Ministry of Climate set a national carbon reduction target of 53-61% by 2035 compared to 2018 levels. Industry insiders, who had called even a 48% reduction \"difficult,\" now label the goal \"virtually impossible.\" The ministry further announced that electric and hydrogen vehicle sales should reach 70% of new cars by 2035. This year, eco-friendly vehicles accounted for just 14% of domestic new car sales. An industry source stated, \"Given current infrastructure and technological progress, this is effectively a ban on internal combustion engine sales.\"\n\nThe automotive sector fears South Korea's \"solo overdrive\" will lead to catastrophic consequences. First, an export cliff: If Korea forces an EV-centric production system while the U.S. and Europe slow EV adoption and favor hybrids and internal combustion engines, Korean automakers may find themselves with nowhere to sell. Over half of Korea's 10,000 auto parts suppliers produce internal combustion engine components, and 95% of these are small and medium-sized enterprises with limited financial resilience. Forcing rapid EV transitions could trigger mass bankruptcies. \"Speed control is urgently needed,\" said one automotive industry official.",

      "body": "EU shifts policy amid industry decline, Chinese EVs; South Korea maintains 70% zero-emission target by 2035 despite backlash\n\nThe European Union (EU) has effectively reversed its policy to ban the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles starting in 2035. Even Europe, the birthplace of environmental regulations, is adjusting its pace. In contrast, the South Korean government has finalized an aggressive target for transitioning to electric vehicles, diverging from global trends and raising concerns in the industry.\n\nAccording to the British Financial Times (FT) on the 15th (local time), the European Commission is pushing to revise laws to allow limited production of internal combustion engine vehicles even after 2035. Initially, the EU planned to completely ban sales of new cars emitting carbon dioxide from 2035, but the revised bill would permit production up to 10% of 2021 emission levels. The EU's U-turn stems from the recognition that an overly rapid shift to electric vehicles has led to the decline of its domestic auto industry and an influx of Chinese-made electric cars. The United States has also recently realigned its industrial policy toward internal combustion engines, suggesting that the global pace of electric vehicle adoption will slow significantly.\n\nMeanwhile, despite industry backlash, the South Korean government is maintaining its roadmap to ensure that over 70% of new vehicles sold by 2035 are zero-emission (electric and hydrogen vehicles), effectively phasing out internal combustion engines.",

But under Tuesday's proposal, the reduction of CO2 emissions will be reduced by 90 per cent from 2021 levels, instead of 100 per cent.\n\nManfred Weber - the German president of the EPP, the largest group in the European Parliament - said his understanding was that the 90 per cent level had been agreed upon by the Commission and that the scaled-back reduction still represented progress.\n\n\"A 90 per cent reduction on 2035 is a massive reduction,\" he told a press conference in Strasbourg.\n\nThe move, which will need approval from EU governments and the European Parliament, would be the EU's most significant climb-down from its green policies of the past five years.\n\nIt comes as US carmaker Ford Motor announced on Monday it would take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in response to the Trump administration's policies and weakening EV demand.\n\nEuropean carmakers such as Volkswagen VOWG.DE and Fiat owner Stellantis STLAM.MI have also pointed to weak EV demand and called for an easing of targets and the fines for missing them.\n\nAutomotive lobby group ACEA called it \"high noon\" for the sector, adding that the Commission should ease intermediate 2030 targets as well.\n\nGerman carmakers in particular are feeling the pinch as they lose market share in China to local automakers and are threatened at home from imports of slick new Chinese EVs.

      "title": "Expected scrapping of planned EU ban on combustion-engine cars 'disappointing', says O'Gorman",
      "body": "Roderic O'Gorman said that as the number of Irish consumers choosing to purchase EVs rises, it's a 'disappointing decision' by the EU.\n\nGREEN PARTY LEADER Roderic O'Gorman has said the expectation that the EU will scrap a planned 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars is \"disappointing\" and will be bad for both consumers and EU industry.\n\nThe measure is expected to be included in a package of reforms aimed at supporting the EU's auto industry.\n\nThe ban was initially adopted in 2023 as part of a range of initiatives to combat climate change, but carmakers and their backers have lobbied Brussels for it to be relaxed over the last year, citing competition from China and a slower than expected shift to electric vehicles.\n\nThe European Commission is expected to propose replacing the ban with a 90% emissions reduction target. The less ambitious proposal is seen as undermining the EU's green agenda by critics.\n\nO'Gorman said today that as the number of Irish consumers choosing to purchase EVs rises, it's a \"disappointing decision\" by the EU.\n\n\"At a time when Irish consumers are looking for choice and looking for better value, the EU is moving in the exact opposite direction, [which is] bad for European industry as well,\" the TD said, citing figures that show that of Irish consumers buying new vehicles this year, 18% opted for EVs.\n\n\"The big winners here are the Chinese companies, the big EV companies, who are selling into the European market, and by allowing the European car manufacturers be complacent, it's actually going to lose Europe market share and investment in the in the longer term.\"\n\nHe highlighted environmental concerns and a lack of clarity on how Europe plans on reducing its transport emissions.\n\nIn the EU, talks on the matter are reportedly going down to the wire as officials attempt to come to an agreement on what vehicles will be allowed to be sold after the deadline.\n\nCarmakers argue the 2035 goal to have only electric vehicles sold in Europe, and an intermediate 2030 target, are no longer realistic.\n\nHigh upfront costs and the lack of adequate charging infrastructure in parts of the 27-nation bloc mean consumers have been slow to warm to EVs, producers say.\n\nJust over 16% of new vehicles sold in the first nine months of 2025 run on batteries, according to ACEA.\n\nAutomakers would like to see continued sales authorised for plug-in hybrids or those equipped with range extenders - small combustion engines that recharge the battery instead of powering the wheels.\n\nGermany and some eastern European nations support this, despite questions about the vehicles' green credentials, with a recent report indicating that plug-in hybrids pollute almost as much as petrol cars.\n\nOthers, like Italy, want to see the use of alternative fuels such as those derived from agricultural crops and waste products allowed.\n\nEnvironmental groups oppose a massive take-up of biofuels, saying it would likely boost the use of pesticides, soil depletion and deforestation.\n\nThe commission is also expected to unveil additional measures to support the sector, including plans for \"greening\" company fleets and encouraging production of small and \"affordable\" EVs.\n\nFrance has advocated for a \"European preference\" compelling manufacturers that receive public subsidies to source components from within the bloc.\n\nRoad transport accounts for about 20% of total planet-warming emissions in Europe, and 61% of those come from cars' exhaust pipes, according to the EU.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jane Matthews and AFP\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.

      "body": "The European Commission is expected to propose easing the European Unions effective ban on sales of new combustion-engine cars from 2035 this Tuesday, as Brussels weighs how best to balance climate ambitions with growing pressure from governments and an auto industry facing fierce global competition.\n\nThe move, still being finalised ahead of its unveiling, could see the ban pushed back by up to five years or softened indefinitely, according to EU officials and industry sources.\n\nThe 2023 law requires all new cars and vans sold in the bloc from 2035 to be CO2-emission-free.\n\nAny revision would mark the EUs most significant rethink of its green transport policies in recent years, reflecting concerns from major member states such as Germany and Italy, and fromautomakersstruggling to keep pace with lower-cost Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers and US rivals.\n\n\"The European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,\" Manfred Weber, president of the European Parliaments largest group, the European Peoples Party (EPP), said on Friday. \"It was a serious industrial policy mistake.\"\n\nNot all governments agree, however, as Spains Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has urged the Commission to hold firm, warning that weakening the policy could undermine Europes efforts to build a globally competitive EV industry.\n\nIn a letter toEuropean CommissionPresident Ursula von der Leyen, Sanchez said further watering down of the rules risked delaying investment and threatening jobs by slowing the transition to electric mobility.\n\n\"We therefore reject that combustion vehicles or other technologies without proven viability could continue to be marketed beyond 2035,\" the letter said.\n\nEuropean carmakers clash over emission targets ahead of Brussels meeting\n\nThe debate has highlighted sharp divisions within Europes car industry itself.\n\nTraditional manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Fiat-ownerStellantishave lobbied for greater flexibility, arguing that EV demand has fallen short of expectations as consumers remain wary of higher prices and patchy charging infrastructure.\n\nEU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs have only marginally eased the pressure.\n\n\"Its not a sustainable reality today in Europe,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said last week, as he announced a partnership with Renault aimed at cutting EV costs.\n\nEU lawmakers vote to support ban on fossil fuel vehicles by 2035\n\nBy contrast, EV makers and charging companies say the technology is ready and that any rollback risks sending the wrong signal to investors.\n\n\"The technology is ready, charging infrastructure is ready, and consumers are ready,\" said Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller. \"So what are we waiting for?\"\n\nAutomakers are pushing to continue selling combustion-engine vehicles alongside plug-in hybrids, range-extender EVs and cars running on so-called CO2-neutral fuels, including e-fuels and advanced biofuels made from waste products. Von der Leyen said in October she was open to such alternatives.\n\n\"We recommend a multi-technology approach,\" said Todd Anderson, chief technology officer at fuel-systems supplier Phinia, adding that the internal combustion engine would \"be around for the rest of the century.\"\n\nWeber has suggested the commission could propose replacing the zero-emissions requirement with a 90 percent reduction in fleet CO2 emissions by 2035. Automakers also want the 2030 target of a 55 percent reduction in car emissions to be phased-in over several years, and to drop the 50 percent reduction target for vans.\n\nEuropean carmakers clash over emission targets ahead of Brussels meeting\n\nGermany has argued that sustainable practices such as using low-carbon steel should count towardsemissionsreductions an idea echoed by Spain, which called for a \"green steel label\"and a mandatory minimum share of EU-manufactured content in vehicles.\n\nThe commission is also expected to outline measures to boostEVuptake in corporate fleets, which account for around 60 percent of new car sales in Europe. The industry favours incentives rather than mandatory quotas, pointing to Belgium as an example where subsidies have helped accelerate adoption.\n\nEnvironmentalgroups, however, say the EU should stay the course.\n\n\"Europe needs to stay the course on electric,\" said William Todts, executive director of clean transport advocacy group T&E. \"Its clear electric is the future.",

      "title": "Brussels Slams Brakes On 2035 Combustion Engine Ban",
      "body": "The European Commission is preparing to retreat from its planned 2035 ban on new combustion-engine car sales, yielding to pressure from Germany, Italy and automakers struggling to compete with U.S. and Chinese rivals, according to Reuters. The announcement is expected Tuesday.\n\nEU and industry sources say the ban could be delayed by five years or softened indefinitely, turning a once-firm rule into something more aspirational. The reversal would mark the bloc's biggest climb-down from its green agenda in the past five years.\n\n\"The European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,\" said Manfred Weber, head of the European Parliament's largest political group. \"It was a serious industrial policy mistake.\"\n\nTraditional automakers such as Volkswagen and Stellantis have lobbied hard for relief, arguing EV demand has fallen short, costs remain high and charging infrastructure is uneven. EU tariffs on Chinese EVs have barely dented the pressure.\n\n\"It's not a sustainable reality today in Europe,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said last week, adding industry needs were \"not well balanced\" with EU CO2 targets.\n\nEV-focused companies warn the rethink hands China an even bigger advantage in electrification.\n\n\"The technology is ready, charging infrastructure is ready, and consumers are ready,\" said Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller. \"So what are we waiting for?\"\n\nReuters writes that the 2023 law was meant to force a rapid shift to batteries or fuel cells, with fines for non-compliance. But European carmakers still trail Tesla and Chinese groups like BYD and Geely on scale and cost. Earlier this year, the EU already granted automakers \"breathing space\" by spreading 2025 compliance over three years.\n\nManufacturers now want to keep selling combustion engines alongside plug-in hybrids, range-extender EVs and vehicles running on so-called CO2-neutral fuels. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signaled openness to e-fuels and \"advanced biofuels\" in October.\n\n\"We recommend a multi-technology approach,\" said Todd Anderson of Phinia, adding the internal combustion engine will \"be around for the rest of the century.\"\n\nEV industry players say regulatory backtracking will undermine investment.\n\n\"It's definitely going to have an effect,\" said ChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer.\n\nAutomakers also want the 2030 target of a 55% cut in car emissions phased in over several years and the 50% reduction target for vans dropped. Germany wants climate credits for low-carbon steel and other upstream measures.\n\nEnvironmental groups say the EU should stick to the 2035 deadline, arguing biofuels are scarce, expensive and not truly carbon-neutral.\n\n\"Europe needs to stay the course on electric,\" said William Todts of T&E. \"It's clear electric is the future.\"\n\nWhether Brussels actually stays the course, or keeps rewriting the rules when reality intervenes, remains to be seen.",

      "body": "The move, the details of which are still being hashed out by EU officials ahead of its unveiling, could see the effective ban pushed back by five years or softened indefinitely, official and industry sources said.\n\nThe likely revision to the 2023 law requiring all new cars and vans sold in the 27-nation bloc from 2035 to be CO2 emission-free would be the European Union's most significant climb-down from its green policies of the past five years.\n\n\"The European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,\" Manfred Weber, head of the European Parliament's largest group, the European People's Party, said on Friday. \"It was a serious industrial policy mistake.\"\n\nReneging on the ban has divided the sector. Traditional automakers like Volkswagen and Fiat-owner Stellantis have pushed hard for targets to be eased amid fierce competition from lower-cost Chinese rivals. The EV sector, however, sees it as yielding more ground to China in the electrification shift.\n\n\"The technology is ready, charging infrastructure is ready, and consumers are ready,\" said EV maker Polestar's CEO Michael Lohscheller. \"So what are we waiting for?\"\n\nCombustion Engines Around For 'Rest Of Century'\n\nThe 2023 law was designed to accelerate a transition from combustion engines to batteries or fuel cells and fine automakers who failed to meet the targets.\n\nMeeting the targets means selling more electric vehicles, where European carmakers lag Tesla and Chinese producers like BYD and Geely.\n\nEurope's carmakers are making EVs, but say demand has lagged expectations as consumers are reluctant to buy more expensive EVs and charging infrastructure is insufficient. EU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs have only slightly eased the pressure.\n\n\"It's not a sustainable reality today in Europe,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told reporters in France last week, announcing a partnership with Renault to help cut EV costs. Industry needs were \"not well balanced\" with EU CO2 targets, he said.\n\nThe EU granted the sector \"breathing space\" in March, allowing automakers to comply with 2025 targets over three years.\n\nBut automakers want to continue selling combustion-engine models alongside plug-in hybrids, range extender EVs with 'CO2-neutral' fuels - including biofuels made from agricultural residues and waste such as used cooking oil.\n\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen said in October she was open to use of e-fuels and \"advanced biofuels\".\n\n\"We recommend a multi-technology approach,\" said Todd Anderson, chief technology officer at combustion-engine fuel systems maker Phinia, adding the internal combustion engine will \"be around for the rest of the century.\"\n\nDivided Opinion\n\nThe EV industry meanwhile argues the move will undermine investment and push the EU even further behind China.\n\n\"It's definitely going to have an effect,\" said Rick Wilmer, CEO of charging hardware and software provider ChargePoint.\n\nAutomakers want the 2030 target of a 55% reduction in car emissions to be phased over several years and to drop the 50% reduction for vans. Germany wants sustainable practices like using low-carbon steel to count towards CO2 emission reductions.\n\nThe European Commission will also detail a plan to boost the share of EVs in corporate fleets, notably company cars, which make up about 60% of Europe's new car sales. The auto industry wants incentives, pointing to Belgium as a country where subsidies have worked, rather than mandatory targets.\n\nThe Commission is likely to propose establishing a new regulatory category for small EVs that would enjoy lower taxes and earn extra credits towards meeting CO2 targets.\n\nEnvironmental campaign groups say the EU should stick to its 2035 target, arguing biofuels are in short supply, are not truly CO2-neutral and supplying them would be prohibitively expensive.\n\n\"Europe needs to stay the course on electric,\" said William Todts, executive director of clean transport advocacy group T&E. \"It's clear electric is the future.\"",

      "body": "The European Commission is poised to ease its 2035 ban on new combustion-engine cars, allowing up to 10% of sales to include non-electric options like plug-in hybrids and range extenders using CO2-neutral biofuels or synthetic fuels. This reversal follows intense lobbying from Germany, Italy, and Europe's auto sector, including giants like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, as they grapple with competition from Tesla and Chinese EVs. The proposal requires approval from EU governments and the European Parliament.\n\nThis marks the EU's biggest retreat from its aggressive green policies in recent years, with carmakers also urging relaxed 2030 CO2 targets and fines. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) has described the situation as \"high noon\" for the industry. However, EV advocates warn that diluting the 100% zero-emissions goal to 90% could erode investments and hand more market dominance to China.\n\nTo counterbalance, the Commission plans incentives for EVs in corporate fleets -- which drive 60% of new car sales -- potentially with local content rules and tax breaks for small EVs. Credits toward CO2 targets may also reward sustainable practices like low-carbon steel production, though the auto sector prefers incentives over mandates.",

      "title": "EU Signals Major Shift on 2035 Combustion Engine Ban Amid Auto Industry Pressure - EconoTimes",
      "body": "The European Commission is preparing to soften its landmark 2035 ban on new combustion-engine cars, marking what could become the most significant rollback of the EU's green transport policies in recent years. Under the proposed change, up to 10% of new vehicles sold after 2035 could be non-electric, following strong lobbying from Germany, Italy, and Europe's powerful automotive sector.\n\nAccording to sources, the Commission is considering allowing the continued sale of plug-in hybrid vehicles and range extenders that run on CO2-neutral biofuels or synthetic fuels. European carmakers argue this flexibility is essential as they struggle to keep pace with Tesla and rapidly advancing Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers. Companies such as Volkswagen and Stellantis, the owner of Fiat, have also urged Brussels to relax emissions targets and reduce fines for missing interim goals.\n\nThe proposal, which still requires approval from EU member states and the European Parliament, has sparked intense debate. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) described the situation as \"high noon\" for the industry and called on policymakers to ease not only the 2035 target but also intermediate 2030 emissions requirements.\n\nHowever, the electric vehicle industry and climate advocates warn that weakening the EU's zero-emissions mandate could undermine investment and further erode Europe's competitiveness in the global EV race. Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller cautioned that shifting from a 100% zero-emissions target to 90% could damage both climate goals and Europe's industrial future. Clean transport group Transport & Environment echoed this view, arguing that clinging to combustion engines risks leaving Europe behind as China accelerates its EV expansion.\n\nIn parallel, the Commission is expected to unveil measures to increase electric vehicle adoption in corporate fleets, particularly company cars, which make up around 60% of new car sales in Europe. While details remain unclear, options may include local content requirements, new incentives, or regulatory credits. The Commission is also likely to propose a new category for small electric vehicles with lower taxes and additional CO2 credits, as well as rewards for more sustainable manufacturing practices such as the use of low-carbon steel.\n\nIf adopted, these changes would reshape the EU's automotive and climate strategy at a critical moment for the global transition to electric mobility.",

      "body": "Germany claims to have managed to get a relaxation of one of the most important climate measures of the European Union - the ban on the sale of new cars with internal combustion engines from 2035. But messages are coming from Brussels that Berlin is celebrating too soon; the final decision has not yet been made. Everything should be clearer on Tuesday, when the European Commission presents the so-called car package. It includes a reform of the legislation that foresees a complete ban on the sale of vehicles that emit CO\u2082 from 2035, but also a new initiative that involves the transition of corporate fleets to more environmentally friendly vehicles.\n\n\"A ban on engine technology is no longer on the table,\" said Manfred Weber, chairman of the European People's Party group; adding that the Commission's easing was achieved in agreement with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. \"\n\nThis is an important signal to the entire automotive industry and a guarantee of preserving tens of thousands of jobs,\" Weber stressed. However, messages are coming from the European Commission that are much more cautious. Several senior officials warn that the content of the package has not yet been finally agreed; there is resistance to the German proposal.\n\nTwo sources claim that the agreement to reduce the target from 100 percent to 90 percent has not yet been \"cemented\" due to the opposition of some commissioners.\n\nThe stakes in the debate are huge; the automotive sector accounts for about nine percent of EU GDP and employs about seven percent of the total workforce. The industry is facing a trade war, growing competition from China and weak domestic demand that has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic.\n\nManufacturers warn that sales of electric vehicles are growing too slowly to compensate for the decline of classic models. Lowering the target to 90 percent means that a quarter of vehicles after 2035 would still have some form of internal combustion engine; these are hybrids or electric vehicles with a small gasoline engine to charge the battery.\n\nEnvironmental organizations point out: \"In a world where almost everyone knows that electric drive is the future, this is a short-term strategy with disastrous consequences for future competitiveness\". The debate among member states is intensifying; France is asking for flexibility, Germany is opposed, and Spain wants the 2035 target to remain unchanged. The Commission's final decision is still a long way off; negotiations with the European Parliament and member states are yet to come.",

[emphasis, links added]\n\nFollowing significant pushback from countries with major automotive industrial bases, including Germany, Italy, Poland, and the Czech Republic, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has reportedly agreed to walk back from outlawing the combustion engine in Europe by 2035.\n\nSpeaking of negotiations, the leader of the centre-right European People's Party, Manfred Weber, told German daily Bild that the \"technology ban for internal combustion engines is off the table.\"\n\nThe German politician said that, instead of an outright ban from 2035, car manufacturers will have targets for a 90 percent reduction in carbon emissions, rather than 100 percent. \"There will also be no 100 per cent target from 2040 onwards,\" he said.\n\nWeber claimed that this would mean that \"all engines currently manufactured in Germany can therefore continue to be produced and sold.\"\n\n\"With this, we are fulfilling our two most important promises: We remain committed to climate neutrality. But we are also ensuring technological neutrality. This sends an important signal to the entire automotive industry and secures tens of thousands of industrial jobs.\"\n\nHowever, such plans still need to be formalized and eventually passed by the European Parliament.\n\nEven still, the apparent Weber agreement would still require a major transformation of the German auto industry, with 80 percent of all new vehicles in the country being powered by gasoline or diesel, rather than electric.\n\nThe leader of the powerful centre-right Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU), Markus S\u00f6der, said that the apparent agreement must only be the \"first step,\" saying that a quota of \"ten percent combustion engines is not enough.\"\n\nGerman Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) President Hildegard M\u00fcller said:\n\n\"For the German automotive industry, it is and remains crucial that a technology-neutral, pragmatic approach that takes global developments into account is chosen on the path to climate-neutral and digital mobility of the future.\n\n\"We welcome proposals that take this complexity into account and ensure that industrial value creation has a future in Germany and Europe and that investments can once again be made here.\"\n\nIn addition to pressure from Germany, there was heavy opposition from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has sought to leverage her relationship with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to push back against the green agenda.\n\nMeloni had previously described plans to ban the combustion engine as \"self-destructive.\"\n\n\"Accompanying the industrial sector in the challenge of ecological transition cannot mean dismantling entire sectors,\" she said last year.",

  "executive_brief": "The European Union has dropped its planned 2035 ban on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles, signaling a significant shift in its EV policy. This decision, covered by 170 articles from 123 sources between December 15th and 19th, 2025, reflects growing concerns about the pace of the electric vehicle transition and the competitiveness of the European automotive industry. The overwhelmingly negative sentiment (-0.12 average score) suggests widespread criticism and apprehension surrounding this policy reversal. \n\nStakeholder positions are deeply divided. While companies like Volkswagen and Stellantis, along with politicians like Friedrich Merz and Ursula von der Leyen, support the move as a pragmatic response to market realities and affordability concerns, others, including Donald Trump, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and Polestar, strongly oppose it, citing concerns about climate goals and competitiveness with Chinese manufacturers. Significant financial implications are evident in Ford\u2019s substantial write-downs related to its EV programs (totaling over $20 billion USD), highlighting the economic pressures facing automakers during this transition.",
