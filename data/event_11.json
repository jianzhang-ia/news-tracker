      "body": "Lessons expected to influence emerging clean fuel markets including Africa.\n\nChina Energy Engineering Group, widely known as Energy China, has begun operations at what it describes as the world largest integrated green hydrogen ammonia and methanol project, marking a significant step forward in the industrial use of renewable energy.\n\nThe first phase of the Songyuan Hydrogen Energy Industrial Park in Jilin province has been designed to produce 45,000 tonnes of green hydrogen each year, alongside 200,000 tonnes of green ammonia and green methanol. The state owned engineering group confirmed the project entered operation earlier this week.\n\nAccording to Energy China, the initial phase will save an estimated 600,000 tonnes of standard coal equivalent annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 740,000 tonnes. The project combines wind and solar power generation with energy storage electrolysis and chemical synthesis in a single integrated system.\n\nOne of the most significant achievements of the development is its ability to address the long standing challenge of aligning intermittent renewable power supply with the continuous operating needs of large scale industrial processes. By tightly integrating generation storage and chemical production, the facility enables stable output of clean fuels while reducing renewable energy curtailment.\n\nNi Zhen, party secretary and chairman of Energy China, said hydrogen is central to the future of global energy systems and is increasingly viewed as a strategic growth sector. He added that projects such as Songyuan are helping accelerate the commercialisation of hydrogen while strengthening industrial competitiveness.\n\nThe company said the project has successfully overcome complex technical challenges including the precise coordination of wind solar storage and hydrogen ammonia and methanol production systems. This integrated approach significantly improves project economics and opens new pathways for cost reduction.\n\nEnergy China believes the model demonstrated at Songyuan can support the large scale rollout of green hydrogen and derivative fuels in international markets. For African countries with abundant renewable resources and growing industrial demand, similar projects could play a role in advancing energy security industrialisation and export oriented clean fuel strategies.\n\nLooking ahead, Energy China plans to expand its hydrogen portfolio and use the Songyuan project as a platform for further innovation digital integration and global collaboration as energy systems continue to shift toward low carbon solutions.",

      "title": "Reframing the Australia-Japan energy relationship",
      "body": "Third, it would allow Japan to avoid importing significant amounts of costly hydrogen and ammonia. Adding 30 per cent ammonia to blast furnaces would, at today's prices, cost in the order of AU$41 billion per year. The ammonia required to produce one tonne of iron would cost more than finished green iron from an Australian H2-DRI plant. [50] While importing green iron could cut Japan's emissions by 14 per cent, adding 30 per cent ammonia would cut emissions by around 2 per cent. [51]\n\nFourth, low-cost green iron from Australia would allow Japan's steelmaking industry, and downstream industries dependent on steel, to remain globally competitive as the world moves towards net zero. The cost advantage of importing green iron from Australia is supported by analysis by Japan's Renewable Energy Institute. [52]\n\nWhile there are strong economic, energy security, and climate reasons for Japan to invest in a green iron supply chain with Australia, measures to carefully manage the social costs of this transition, including the reduction in employment related to ironmaking, will be critical to its political feasibility.\n\nYet while ironmaking is the most energy-intensive part of the steel supply chain, it is relatively labour-light. According to a European Union case study, an estimated 10 per cent of jobs in the EU steel sector are directly related to ironmaking, while 90 per cent of jobs are in steelmaking and downstream finishing activities. [53] Japan should similarly view offshoring green ironmaking to Australia as an opportunity to ensure the viability of far more abundant, and higher value, jobs in steelmaking.\n\nHistory provides a striking precedent: Japan was the equal second-largest producer of aluminium in the world in 1970, but the OPEC oil shock prompted it to exit the industry. This contributed to the shift of aluminium smelting to Australia, where energy costs were cheaper. Japanese government, business, and labour unions worked together to implement a suite of employment management, assistance, and reallocation measures. [54] Japan today is greatly better off for the closure of aluminium smelters, which would otherwise aggravate its energy security and emissions challenges.\n\nEventual large-scale imports of green iron from Australia would need to be grounded in trust that Australia will remain a stable and reliable partner. This is in keeping with the overall direction of Australia's relationship with Japan. Australia's recent decision to award Japan a tender for the construction of Mogami-class naval frigates, as well as expanding cooperation on critical minerals processing, reflects the convergence in strategic outlook between Canberra and Tokyo. Cooperating on green iron, a sector of national significance for both countries, would serve to bolster that relationship.\n\nChina is also investing in green hydrogen and green steel production technologies. While it will be a competitor in the industry, China's limited renewable resource endowment may similarly make green iron imports from Australia attractive. [55] Australia, along with other countries with rich renewables endowments, will benefit from Chinese advances in electrolyser technologies, as they have from Chinese advances in solar and wind technologies.\n\nImporting green fuels makes no economic sense where there are good alternatives, such as generating electricity locally or importing energy-intensive goods. Sometimes, however, there are no good alternatives. Green fuels will be essential for some segments of the transport sector, including aviation, long-range shipping, and heavy-duty road freight. Stores of green transport fuels may also contribute to grid stabilisation during typhoons and other events that interrupt renewable energy production.\n\nThe most important green fuels are hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Hydrogen and ammonia require only water and electricity as an input, while methanol and SAF also require a source of carbon.\n\nExpected production costs are similar on a per-Megajoule basis. [56] Methanol and SAF have large advantages in terms of transport costs, safety, and compatibility with existing infrastructure, but the availability of biomass will be a significant constraint.\n\nFor Australia, the opportunity is to supply part of Japan's green fuel needs. If Australia covered 25 per cent of Japan's needs by mid-century, the total export value would reach around AU$20 billion. [57]\n\nProducing these fuels in Japan would be prohibitively expensive. Japan has among the highest-cost renewable energy in the world, and its scarcity of land would make it reliant on biomass imports. Australia has a superabundance of both resources.\n\nIf Japan were to produce enough green fuels to cover its own needs, it would require around 239 TWh and 10 million tonnes of biomass annually. Importing green fuels would avoid these costs, while eliminating up to 12 per cent of national emissions. Costs are presently high, but expected to decline significantly over time.\n\nAustralia has expertise managing renewable-heavy and decentralised power grids, given its world-leading uptake of rooftop solar. It can be a reliable supplier of many critical minerals needed by green industries, such as lithium and nickel. Japan has broad and deep technical expertise, and can lead the development of next-generation renewables, power storage, hydrogen carriers, power-to-fuel, and other technologies that will be essential for the green trade and Australia's decarbonisation.\n\nBoth have strong geopolitical interests in diverse and robust green supply chains that do not leave the region dependent on monopolistic sellers or politically unstable partners. Today, Australia and Japan are among the most strategically aligned countries in Asia, and are actively increasing their investments in military cooperation and deterrence capabilities. An economic partnership built on growing, rather than shrinking, industries would strengthen these bonds for the long term.\n\nGeographic proximity not only reduces transport costs, but also eliminates the bottlenecks that endanger supply from other countries, for example the Middle East. And most importantly, Australia and Japan have established strong trust built on half a century of trade.\n\nFinally, success in the bilateral energy transition could serve as a model for joint regional decarbonisation efforts, with Japan and Australia leveraging each other's strengths to support electrification, renewable deployment, grid connectivity, and industrial decarbonisation in Southeast Asia -- a growing centre of global energy demand.",

Photo: Courtesy of China Energy Green Hydrogen Ammonia New Energy (Songyuan) Co.\n\nThe world's largest integrated green hydrogen-ammonia-methanol project officially began operations on Tuesday in Songyuan, Northeast China's Jilin Province. A Chinese expert said that the launch marks a key breakthrough in further strengthening China's ability to manage renewable energy supply while enabling continuous and stable chemical production, and offers a model for the global commercialization of green hydrogen.\n\nThe project, also known as the China Energy Engineering Group Songyuan Hydrogen Energy Industrial Park Phase I, was developed with investment from China Energy Engineering Corp (Energy China), with a planned annual output of 45,000 tons of green hydrogen, 200,000 tons of green ammonia and green methanol, according to Energy China.\n\nIt stands out for several world-leading features, including being the world's largest integrated green hydrogen-ammonia-methanol project. The project spans the entire industrial chain, from renewable power generation and hydrogen production to hydrogen storage, hydrogen-based chemicals, and equipment manufacturing. Its Phase I capacity of 200,000 tons of green ammonia and green methanol is considered the largest among comparable projects worldwide, according to the company.\n\nIn addition, it is the world's largest ground-based hydrogen storage project, with total storage capacity sufficient to meet the daily cooking needs of 600,000 people, according to the company.\n\nUpon entering operation, the project received the ISCC EU green certification from an internationally recognized authority and signed the world's first contract for the sale of green ammonia as an ocean-going shipping fuel, injecting momentum into China's hydrogen industry as it moves from pilot demonstrations toward large-scale commercial application, said Sun Xiang, deputy general manager of China Energy Green Hydrogen Ammonia New Energy (Songyuan) Co.\n\nConstruction of the Songyuan project began in September 2023, with a phased plan to build 3 million kilowatts of renewable power generation and 800,000 tons of green synthetic ammonia and methanol. Phase I includes 800,000 kilowatts of renewable power generation, capable of producing 45,000 tons of green hydrogen and 200,000 tons of green ammonia and methanol annually, which is equivalent to saving about 600,000 tons of standard coal and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 740,000 tons each year, the Global Times learned from the developer.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the decision to locate the project in Songyuan, including abundant local wind and solar resources, lower construction costs, rich water resources, and the presence of well-established chemical parks and transportation infrastructure in the area, in additional to policy support, Sun told the Global Times.\n\nThe project's launch is exciting as it further boosts the nation's ability to use renewable energy efficiently while maintaining stable chemical production and serving as a practical model for the global commercialization of green hydrogen, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.\n\nChina's combined installed capacity of wind and solar power has exceeded 1.7 billion kilowatts, surpassing thermal power to become one of the largest sources of electricity, according to industry data. However, Lin said that the rapid expansion of renewables has also created the need to effectively absorb newly added capacity each year, putting traditional power consumption and integration models under growing strain.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, hydrogen energy, a secondary energy source that is abundant, green, low-carbon, and widely applicable, has been incorporated into the national energy management framework and is emerging as a key component in building a new energy system and a new type of power system, Lin said.\n\nIn recent years, China's hydrogen industry has grown rapidly, with its related sectors leading the world. As of the end of 2024, the cumulative installed capacity of renewable energy\u2011based hydrogen projects worldwide exceeded 250,000 tons per year, with China accounting for more than 50 percent, gradually establishing itself as a global leader in the development of renewable hydrogen and related industries, according to the National Energy Administration.\n\nIn October, hydrogen power was included in the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30), sending a clear signal of the government's support for the industry's development.",

      "body": "(Yicai) Dec. 16 -- The world's largest green hydrogen-ammonia-methanol integrated project, built by China's state-owned energy infrastructure giant China Energy Engineering Corp., has entered operation in Northeast China's Jilin province, marking a milestone in the deep integration of renewable energy and the chemical industry.\n\nLocated in Songyuan, Jilin, the Qingqing No. 1 project has a total planned investment of nearly CNY30 billion (USD4.3 billion). It will ultimately deploy three million kilowatts of wind and photovoltaic power generation capacity and support green synthetic ammonia and green methanol facilities with a combined annual output of 800,000 tons, CCTV News reported today.\n\nUnder the project's model, electricity generated from wind and photovoltaic sources is transmitted to a chemical industrial park to electrolyze water and produce hydrogen, which is then converted into ammonia and methanol through mature chemical processes. This enables long-term storage and transportation of green energy to global markets, per the report.\n\nThe first phase, which began operation today, includes 800,000 kilowatts of new energy power generation capacity and green synthetic ammonia and methanol facilities with an annual capacity of 200,000 tons. Once fully operational, the phase is expected to reduce standard coal consumption by about 600,000 tons and cut carbon emissions by 1.4 million tons per year, according to the report.\n\nThe project has overcome the long-standing challenge of matching the volatility of wind and solar power generation with the stable operating requirements of the chemical industry, opening up a practical new path for China to absorb large-scale renewable energy and advance the development of green chemicals, said Ni Zhen, chairman of China Energy Engineering.\n\nTo address the core issue of unstable renewable power output, the Qingqing No. 1 team has applied technologies, including Big Data and artificial intelligence, to adjust hydrogen production and chemical processing loads in real time based on wind and solar output. This ensures continuous chemical production while maximizing renewable energy utilization, project technicians said.\n\nChina has accelerated the green and low-carbon transformation of its energy sector this year. The country's annual hydrogen production capacity from renewable energy sources has exceeded 220,000 tons, accounting for more than 50 percent of global green hydrogen capacity, while the combined annual capacity of green ammonia and green methanol stands at around one million tons, Wang Hongzhi, head of the National Energy Administration, said at the National Energy Work Conference held yesterday.",

  "executive_brief": "Energy China has initiated operations of the world's largest integrated green hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol project, as reported across 7 sources with overwhelmingly positive sentiment (average score 0.75). This represents a significant milestone in China\u2019s strategy to expand its clean energy sector and leverage renewable resources. The project\u2019s scale \u2013 with 3,000,000 kW planned renewable power generation capacity and a 1,400,000 tons reduction in carbon emissions \u2013 positions it as a potentially influential model for global commercialization of green fuel production.\n\nStakeholders, including Energy China, China Energy Engineering Corp, and Japan, express strong support for the project, citing its potential to drive economic growth, improve renewable energy economics, and enhance energy security. Financial implications are substantial, with a total planned investment of CNY 30,000,000,000 (USD 4,300,000,000) and potential export opportunities for countries like Australia, which could see AUD 20,000,000,000 in value by supplying Japan\u2019s green fuel needs. Ni Zhen of Energy China emphasizes hydrogen\u2019s central role in the future of global energy systems.",
