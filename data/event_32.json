Prior \u2063to her televised appearance, Rodr\u00edguez was rumored to be in Russia, \u2062a key ally of the Maduro regime.

      "body": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Uncertainty gripped Venezuela on Saturday as people scrambled to understand who was in charge of the South American country after a U.S. military operation captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\n\"What will happen tomorrow? What will happen in the next hour? Nobody knows,\" Caracas resident Juan Pablo Petrone said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered a shocking pick for who would take control: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro's most trusted aides.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez has served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela's oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n\"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" Trump told reporters of Rodr\u00edguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump's first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nLong lines wound through supermarkets and outside gas stations as Venezuelans long used to crises stocked up once again. Small pro-government rallies broke out in parts of Caracas, but most streets remained empty in the nation of 29 million people.\n\nIn a major snub, Trump said opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded last year's Nobel Peace Prize, didn't have the support to run the country.\n\nTrump said Rodr\u00edguez had a long conversation with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in which Trump claimed she said, \"'We'll do whatever you need.'\"\n\n\"I think she was quite gracious,\" Trump added. \"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez tried to project strength and unity among the ruling party's many factions, downplaying any hint of betrayal. In remarks on state TV, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and denounced the U.S. operation as a flagrant violation of the United Nations charter.\n\n\"There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\" Rodr\u00edguez said, surrounded by top civilian officials and military commanders.\n\nThere was no immediate sign that the U.S. was running Venezuela.\n\nNo sign of a swearing-in\n\nTrump indicated that Rodr\u00edguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodr\u00edguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n\"What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\" she said. \"History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan constitution also says a new election must be called within a month in the event of the president's absence. But experts have been debating whether the succession scenario would apply here, given the government's lack of popular legitimacy and the extraordinary U.S. military intervention.\n\nVenezuelan military officials were quick to project defiance in video messages.\n\n\"They have attacked us but will not break us,\" said Defense Minister Gen. Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, dressed in fatigues.\n\nInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared on state TV in a helmet and flak jacket, urging Venezuelans to \"trust in the political leadership and military\" and \"get out on the streets\" to defend the country's sovereignty.\n\n\"These rats attacked and they will regret what they did,\" he said of the U.S.\n\nJump start your day.\n\nHeadlines, puzzles and death notices from the Valley delivered to your inbox 7 a.m. daily.\n\nSign Up\n\nCaracas residents like Yanire Lucas were left picking up shattered glass and other debris after an early-morning explosion in a military base next to her house.\n\n\"What is happening is unprecedented,\" Lucas said, adding that her family is scared to leave home. \"We're still on edge, and now we're uncertain about what to do.\"\n\nStrong ties with Wall Street\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodr\u00edguez has a long history of representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez on the world stage.\n\nShe and her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have strong leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who died in police custody in the 1970s, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro's inner circle, the Rodr\u00edguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S. Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change.\n\nAmong her past interlocutors was Blackwater founder Erik Prince and, more recently, Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy who tried to negotiate a deal with Maduro for greater U.S. influence in Venezuela.\n\nFluent in English, Rodr\u00edguez is sometimes portrayed as a well-educated moderate in contrast to the military hardliners who took up arms with Ch\u00e1vez against Venezuela's democratically elected president in the 1990s.\n\nMany of them, especially Cabello, are wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges and stand accused of serious human rights abuses. But they continue to hold sway over the armed forces, the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela.\n\nThat presents major challenges to Rodr\u00edguez asserting authority. But experts say that Venezuela's power brokers have long had a habit of closing ranks behind their leaders.\n\n\"These leaders have all seen the value of staying united. Cabello has always taken a second seat or third seat, knowing that his fate is tied up with Maduro's, and now he very well might do that again,\" said David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has conducted research into Venezuela's political dynamics over the past three decades.\n\n\"A lot depends on what happened last night, which officials were taken out, what the state of the military looks like now,\" Smilde said. \"If it doesn't have much firepower anymore, they're more vulnerable and diminished and it will be easier for her to gain control.\"\n\nAn apparent snub of the opposition\n\nShortly before Trump's press conference, Machado, the opposition leader, called on her ally Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez -- a retired diplomat widely considered to have won the country's disputed 2024 presidential election -- to \"immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nIn an triumphant statement, Machado promised that her movement would \"restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional country and bring our children back home.\"\n\nShe added: \"Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and take power.\"\n\nAsked about Machado, Trump was blunt: \"I think it would be very tough for (Machado) to be the leader,\" he said.\n\n\"She doesn't have the support or respect within the country.\"\n\nVenezuelans expressed shock, with many speculating on social media that Trump had mixed up the two women's names. Machado has not responded to Trump's remarks.\n\nGoodman reported from Miami. Associated Press journalist Juan Arraez in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Trump: Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's VP Delcy Rodr\u00edguez Spoke to Rubio, Willing to 'Make Venezuela Great Again'",
      "body": "President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as head of Venezuela following the capture of socialist dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by U.S. forces earlier that day.\n\n\"I understand she was just sworn in, but she was, as you know, picked by Maduro. Marco [Rubio] is working on that directly. He just had a conversation with her, and she's essentially willing to do what we think its necessary to Make Venezuela great again, very simple,\" President Trump told reporters.\n\nAt another part of the press conference, President Trump said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth will be a \"team\" that will work with the people of Venezuela to make sure that \"we have Venezuela right.\"\n\n\"Because for us to just leave, who's gonna take over? I mean, there's nobody to take over. You have a Vice President who's been appointed by Maduro, and right now she is the Vice President and she is, I guess, the President, she was sworn as President just a little while ago,\" President Trump said. \"She had a long conversation with Marco and she said, 'We'll do whatever you need.' I think she was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018 and as oil minister since 2024 in addition to having occupied several other high-ranking positions at the Maduro regime throughout the past two decades. Her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, presently serves as head of the socialist-controlled National Assembly, with the brother-and-sister-group representing one of the most powerful alliances of the regime's civilian wing. The Venezuelan vice presidency is not a democratically elected position and can be freely appointed and removed by the president as per the nation's constitution.\n\nRodr\u00edguez's whereabouts remain publicly uncertain at press time. Reuters, citing \"four sources familiar with her movements,\" said that the Venezuelan Vice President was in Russia -- but noted that the Russian Foreign Ministry \"dismissed the report about Rodriguez's presence in their country as 'fake.'\"\n\nOn Saturday morning, Rodr\u00edguez spoke to VTV, the Venezuelan regime's flagship news channel, and asserted that the Venezuelan regime had no information on Maduro's whereabouts after he and his wife Cilia Flores were captured by U.S. forces earlier that day. Rodr\u00edguez demanded that the U.S. government immediately shows \"proof of life\" of Maduro and Flores.\n\nIn 2018, during President Trump's first term, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, her brother Jorge, the now-captured Cilia Flores, and other members of the Maduro regime. Similarly, the European Union imposed sanctions on Delcy Rodr\u00edguez in 2018.",

      "body": "After months of escalating US pressure on Venezuela, the crisis reached a dramatic turning point on Saturday with the US capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. According to President Donald Trump, Maduro was seized in a late night military operation and transferred to a US naval vessel to be transported to New York to face charges related to drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. The operation reportedly included large-scale military strikes, marking the most direct intervention to date.\n\nWhile Maduro is now out of power, the political future of Venezuela remains uncertain. Trump said the United States would effectively be \"running\" the country for the foreseeable future, though he offered few details on what that would entail. Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, has been sworn in, and US officials have suggested a willingness to work with existing regime figures, even as Rodr\u00edguez publicly rejected any notion of US control and called for Maduro's return. As details of the operation continue to emerge, major questions remain. Follow along here for the latest updates and analysis.",

      "title": "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez Signals Openness to Respectful Diplomatic Dialogue",
      "body": "In a statement issued on Saturday, Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez expressed her government's willingness to engage in \"respectful\" relations \"within the framework of international legality.\" This announcement came just hours following the capture of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores during a U.S. military operation.\n\nSpeaking from Caracas, Rodr\u00edguez demanded the \"immediate release\" of Maduro, whom she described as the \"sole president\" of Venezuela. She also highlighted the outrage among the Venezuelan populace over what she termed the \"illegal and illegitimate abduction\" of both Maduro and Flores, emphasizing that \"all of Venezuela\" had been mobilized in response.\n\nAs part of the official response, Rodr\u00edguez mentioned that the National Defense Council had been activated, alongside a decree of \"external commotion\" reportedly signed by President Maduro. This decree was set to be delivered to the president of the Supreme Court for constitutional backing in its Constitutional Chamber. She noted that actions outlined in the decree would begin \"immediately\" pending this support.\n\nOn the political front, Rodr\u00edguez asserted that the country \"will not become a colony\" and denounced the events as \"barbaric,\" claiming they violated international law. She affirmed the government's readiness to defend Venezuela and its \"natural resources,\" especially focusing on \"hydrocarbons\" and \"energy resources.\"\n\nIn the latter part of her speech, Rodr\u00edguez outlined conditions for any future discussions. \"We are open to relations of respect... within the framework of international legality and the laws of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\" she stated, adding that this would be the only acceptable framework for interactions post what she described as an attack and military aggression against the nation and Caracas.\n\nHer remarks followed President Trump's assertion that his team had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez, who he claimed had expressed willingness to engage with Washington. However, the transcript provided no further specifics on this communication.\n\nPresident Trump declared that his government would oversee Venezuela and its oil revenues following Maduro's capture, with Delcy Rodr\u00edguez leading a transitional government under terms set by Washington. From his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump emphasized that the United States would take control of the country \"until a fair democratic transition\" occurs, citing the Venezuelan infrastructure as \"rotten\" and promising that the oil would be managed to benefit both the Venezuelan people and compensate the U.S. for previous expropriations.\n\n\"We are going to run this country properly and ensure the Venezuelan people are taken care of,\" Trump stated, not ruling out future military actions should Chavista factions attempt to regain control. Notably, he mentioned that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in dialogue with Rodr\u00edguez, whom he described as willing \"to do what we believe needs to be done to make Venezuela great again,\" echoing his own campaign slogan.\n\nTrump suggested that Rodr\u00edguez would assume leadership of a transitional government, while the U.S. would secure and manage strategic resources, particularly oil. \"We'll make a lot of money to take care of the country,\" he added, without specifying timelines or mechanisms.",

      "body": "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, Venezuela's new interim leader, arrives at the job with impeccable leftist credentials.\n\nShe is the daughter of a Marxist guerrilla who won fame for kidnapping an American businessman, was educated partly in France, where she specialized in labor law and rose to meteoric heights in the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom she is succeeding.\n\nBut Ms. Rodr\u00edguez, 56, is also known for building bridges with Venezuela's economic elites, foreign investors and diplomats, presenting herself as a cosmopolitan technocrat in a militaristic and male-dominated government.\n\nAfter Venezuela's economy endured a harrowing crash from 2013 to 2021, she spearheaded a market-friendly overhaul which had provided a semblance of economic stability before the U.S. military campaign targeting Mr. Maduro.\n\nHer privatization of state assets and relatively conservative fiscal policy had left Venezuela somewhat better prepared to resist the Trump administration's blockade of sanctioned tankers carrying oil, the country's economic lifeblood.\n\nThe contradictions enveloping Ms. Rodr\u00edguez were on display on Saturday when she addressed the nation on state television. While President Trump said that Ms. Rodr\u00edguez had been sworn in as Venezuela's new president, it was clear that Mr. Maduro's supporters -- including her -- still see him as Venezuela's legitimate leader.\n\nMs. Rodr\u00edguez repeatedly said that Mr. Maduro was Venezuela's \"only president,\" and even the text on Venezuelan state television labeled her as vice president. When she ended, the state broadcaster immediately said that Ms. Rodr\u00edguez, as the vice president, had just made clear that Mr. Maduro remained Venezuela's president.\n\nMs. Rodr\u00edguez rose to prominence after Mr. Maduro became president in 2013, following the death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the founder of Venezuela's Bolivarian political movement, which blends left-wing and nationalist ideals.\n\nMr. Maduro appointed her as communications minister, before naming her foreign affairs minister, the first woman to hold that post in Venezuela.\n\nShuttling between Latin American capitals, she often seemed to revel in feuding with conservative leaders.\n\nIn 2018, Ms. Rodr\u00edguez was promoted again, this time to the vice presidency, and the head of SEBIN, a Venezuelan intelligence agency. She took on additional duties in 2020 as economy minister and proceeded to extend an olive branch to business elites in Venezuela.\n\nBut she has also been targeted by sanctions from the United States, Canada and the European Union for her role in supporting and helping to oversee crackdowns on dissent in Venezuela.\n\nHer entry into Venezuelan politics seemed natural as the daughter of Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a Marxist leader who led the kidnapping in Venezuela of William Niehous, an American businessman who was held for three years in a jungle hide-out and rescued in 1979.\n\nHer father was arrested and charged for his role in the kidnapping and died in 1976, at the age of 34, after being interrogated by intelligence agents.\n\nPolitics and leftist activism run in the family. Ms. Rodr\u00edguez's older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, is another member of Mr. Maduro's inner circle. He is the president of the National Assembly and was Mr. Maduro's chief political strategist.\n\nAnatoly Kurmanaev contributed reporting from Venezuela.\n\nSimon Romero is a Times correspondent covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.

She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n\"What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\" she said. \"History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan constitution also says a new election must be called within a month in the event of the president\u00b4s absence.\n\nBut experts have been debating whether the succession scenario would apply here, given the government\u00b4s lack of popular legitimacy and the extraordinary U.S. military intervention.\n\nVenezuelan military officials were quick to project defiance in video messages.\n\n\"They have attacked us but will not break us,\" said Defense Minister Gen. Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, dressed in fatigues.\n\nInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared on state TV in a helmet and flak jacket, urging Venezuelans to \"trust in the political leadership and military\" and \"get out on the streets\" to defend the country\u00b4s sovereignty.\n\n\"These rats attacked and they will regret what they did,\" he said of the U.S.\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodr\u00edguez has a long history of representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez on the world stage.\n\nShe and her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have strong leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who died in police custody in the 1970s, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro\u00b4s inner circle, the Rodr\u00edguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S. Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change.\n\nAmong her past interlocutors was Blackwater founder Erik Prince and, more recently, Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy who tried to negotiate a deal with Maduro for greater U.S. influence in Venezuela.\n\nFluent in English, Rodr\u00edguez is sometimes portrayed as a well-educated moderate in contrast to the military hardliners who took up arms with Ch\u00e1vez against Venezuela's democratically elected president in the 1990s.\n\nMany of them, especially Cabello, are wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges and stand accused of serious human rights abuses. But they continue to hold sway over the armed forces, the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela.\n\nThat presents major challenges to Rodr\u00edguez asserting authority. But experts say that Venezuela\u00b4s power brokers have long had a habit of closing ranks behind their leaders.\n\n\"These leaders have all seen the value of staying united. Cabello has always taken a second seat or third seat, knowing that his fate is tied up with Maduro\u00b4s, and now he very well might do that again,\" said David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has conducted research into Venezuela's political dynamics over the past three decades.\n\n\"A lot depends on what happened last night, which officials were taken out, what the state of the military looks like now,\" Smilde said. \"If it doesn\u00b4t have much firepower anymore, they\u00b4re more vulnerable and diminished and it will be easier for her to gain control.\"\n\nShortly before Trump's press conference, Machado, the opposition leader, called on her ally Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez - a retired diplomat widely considered to have won the country\u00b4s disputed 2024 presidential election - to \"immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nIn an triumphant statement, Machado promised that her movement would \"restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional country and bring our children back home.\"\n\nShe added: \"Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and take power.\"\n\nAsked about Machado, Trump was blunt: \"I think it would be very tough for (Machado) to be the leader,\" he said.\n\n\"She doesn\u00b4t have the support or respect within the country.\"\n\nVenezuelans expressed shock, with many speculating on social media that Trump had mixed up the two women's names. Machado has not responded to Trump's remarks.\n\n___\n\nGoodman reported from Miami.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President and Oil Minister Delcy Rodriguez gives a press conference at the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas, Venezuela, March 10, 2025.

She stated that all state institutions were on high alert, citing an external attack on Venezuela.\n\nIn a televised address following a National Defense Council meeting, Rodr\u00edguez detailed the participants: senior government and security officials, including the defense minister, high-ranking military leaders, and the foreign and interior ministers. She emphasized that political, military, and security bodies were functioning at peak readiness throughout the nation.\n\nRodr\u00edguez also noted that Venezuelans had already responded to a previous call for mobilization, with grassroots organizations taking to the streets and the armed forces and security agencies deployed nationwide.\n\nShe presented the actions as necessary to protect the nation's sovereignty and independence.\n\nThe vice president characterized the events as a significant violation of the United Nations Charter, pointing to breaches of its fundamental tenets. She labeled the situation as an act of foreign aggression, which had sparked international alarm.\n\nShe also noted that numerous countries, including China and Russia, along with nations across Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia, had voiced their support for Venezuela.\n\nDrawing on the legacy of independence leader Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Rodr\u00edguez declared that Venezuela would not yield to foreign control, calling for unity among the military, police, and the populace.\n\nShe urged citizens to stay composed and united in the face of threats to the nation's sovereignty.\n\nRodr\u00edguez stated that the government is still willing to engage in dialogue and maintain relationships built on mutual respect and adherence to international law. However, she condemned the reported detention of Maduro and his wife as a \"illegal kidnapping,\" executed during military operations.\n\nShe declared that the National Defense Council would continue to meet regularly, anticipating judicial approval for an emergency decree signed by Maduro. This decree would empower the government to enact further measures within constitutional guidelines.\n\nRodr\u00edguez also took aim at international sanctions imposed on Venezuela, arguing they infringe upon human rights and constitute crimes against humanity. She emphasized the country's resilience in the face of economic hardship and reiterated Venezuela's dedication to preserving peace, independence, and its political future through national unity, not violence.",

She told citizens that the attack on Venezuela was \"barbarity\" and demanded the U.S. release Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.\n\n\"We had already warned that an aggression was underway under false excuses and false pretenses, and that the masks had fallen off, revealing only one objective: regime change in Venezuela,\" she said, according to The New York Times. \"This regime change would also allow for the seizure of our energy, mineral and natural resources. This is the true objective, and the world and the international community must know it.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez added that she is willing to talk and \"have respectful relations\" with the Trump administration.\n\n\"It is the only thing we will accept for a type of relationship after having attacked [Venezuela],\" Rodr\u00edguez said, according to The Associated Press.\n\nFollowing the attack, Rodr\u00edguez called on the U.S. to show \"proof of life\" of Maduro and Flores. She condemned the attacks and capture as a \"complete brutal aggression against our people.\"\n\nThe U.S. carried out strikes in the capital of Caracas early Saturday morning. The U.S. Army's Delta Force entered Maduro's compound and arrested him and Flores. Both were flown to the aircraft carrier USS Iwo Jima headed for New York, where the two will face charges.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi unsealed Maduro and Flores's indicting charges, which are a superseding indictment on Saturday that builds on charges initially filed against Maduro in 2020.\n\nTrump told reporters from his Mar-a-Lago resort that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela until the country has a peaceful transition of power. He did not say if opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado should take over, claiming that she \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country.\"\n\nMachado praised Maduro's capture and wrote in a letter shared on the social platform X that \"the hour of freedom has arrived!\" She said opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, whom Maduro defeated in Venezuela's elections in 2024 amid allegations of widespread voter fraud, should take over.",

      "body": "Venezuela's VP Pushes Back on Trump Claims, Demands Maduro Freed, and Rejects US Control\n\nDelcy Rodriguez Venezuela tensions escalated after the country's vice president went on national television demanding the immediate release of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and rejecting U.S. authority outright. As tensions between Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, Trump, and Venezuela escalate, the Venezuelan vice president went on national television demanding the immediate release of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and declaring that the Venezuelan people will never again be a colony of an empire or slaves to another nation. Her message was direct, defiant, and aimed squarely at the United States.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, who serves as vice president under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, rejected US authority outright while demanding Maduro's immediate release. She said there is only one legitimate president of Venezuela and that foreign governments have no right to remove or detain him.\n\nThe moment carried extra weight because Venezuelan state officials confirmed Rodr\u00edguez had been sworn in to assume executive authority following Maduro's detention, a move the government described as constitutional continuity. Rodr\u00edguez addressed the country as the acting head of state, presenting herself as the legal steward of the presidency until Maduro's return.\n\nThat stance directly clashes with comments made by Donald Trump, who publicly suggested Rodr\u00edguez would comply with US direction and do whatever Washington demanded. Rodr\u00edguez shut that down fast. In her address, she made it clear she answers to the Venezuelan people only and not to the United States, saying her role is to defend national independence, not manage a handoff of power.\n\nShe leaned heavily into history and resistance, reminding viewers that Venezuela's wealth, land, and political future have long been targets of outside control. Her tone wasn't diplomatic. It was defiant. Rodr\u00edguez framed the US actions as an attempt to dominate Venezuela's resources and decision making, and she positioned her leadership as a line in the sand.\n\nThis wasn't just about Maduro. It was about identity. Rodr\u00edguez spoke directly to Venezuelans at home and abroad, calling for unity and calm while insisting the country would not bow to pressure or intimidation. The message was blunt: Venezuela will govern itself, period.",

      "title": "Trump says US will run Venezuela after Maduro capture, but vice president rejects power transfer",
      "body": "\"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump told reporters after announcing the capture of President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on January 3 that Washington would temporarily administer Venezuela following a predawn military operation that ousted President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power, though the country's vice president rejected assuming office and demanded the leader's immediate release.\n\nThe dramatic action, which followed months of secret planning, resulted in Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores being detained at their residence on a military base and transported aboard the USS Iwo Jima to face narco-terrorism charges in New York, according to Trump.\n\nSpeaking at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump announced plans to exploit the leadership vacuum to repair Venezuela's ailing oil infrastructure and sell \"large amounts\" of the country's petroleum reserves to other nations.\n\n\"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump told reporters, describing the operation as a warning to those threatening American sovereignty.\n\nThe US president pointed to Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez as Washington's immediate handpicked successor for Maduro, saying that \"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"\n\nHowever, Rodr\u00edguez appeared on state television a few hours later to reject the US assertion that she had been sworn in as president, declaring Maduro remained Venezuela's sole legitimate leader.\n\n\"There is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros,\" Rodr\u00edguez said, demanding his immediate release.\n\nThe conflicting statements highlighted uncertainty over Venezuela's governance following the operation, which Trump said was conducted under legal authority to stem dangerous drug flows, though lawmakers from both parties questioned the constitutional basis for military action without congressional approval.\n\nOpposition leader sidelined\n\nTrump's plans appeared to sideline opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month for her campaign to restore democracy in Venezuela.\n\nAsked at his news conference whether he had spoken with Machado, Trump replied \"no\" and suggested she lacked sufficient domestic backing to govern Venezuela.\n\n\"She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country\" necessary to lead, Trump said.\n\nThe comments came just hours after Machado declared on social media that \"the hour of freedom has come,\" stating that she and Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez were \"ready to enforce our mandate and take power.\"\n\nMachado had backed Gonz\u00e1lez as the opposition presidential candidate in the 2024 election after regime-aligned authorities barred her from running on trumped-up charges. Opposition-collected voting tallies indicated Gonz\u00e1lez defeated Maduro by a substantial margin, though electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner.\n\nNumerous countries, including the UK, the EU and the United States, recognised Gonz\u00e1lez as the legitimate president-elect. However, Maduro retained support from the military and electoral council and was sworn in for another six-year term.\n\nVenezuela denounces 'illegal kidnapping'\n\nRodr\u00edguez, speaking at an emergency National Defence Council meeting alongside senior government officials, slammed the operation as an \"unprecedented\" military aggression resulting in the \"illegal kidnapping\" of Maduro and Flores.\n\nThe vice president said the true objective was \"regime change in Venezuela\" to enable the United States to \"plunder our energy, mineral, and natural resources,\" calling on the international community to recognise this.\n\nState broadcaster TeleSUR reported Rodr\u00edguez convened the emergency session whilst activating the Citizen Security Agency and national defence apparatus to protect what Venezuela described as its violated independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nRodr\u00edguez noted that Maduro had in a television interview just two days earlier reaffirmed Venezuela's willingness to maintain dialogue with Washington \"to address a constructive agenda\" through diplomatic and political channels based on mutual respect.\n\nShe said the US action \"flagrantly violates Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter of the United Nations,\" despite Venezuela's extended hand to establish relations benefiting both peoples through friendship, cooperation and respect for international law.\n\nThe vice president quoted independence hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's Jamaica Letter, saying: \"The veil has been torn, we have already seen the light and they want to return us to darkness. The chains have been broken, we have already been free and our enemies intend to enslave us again.\"\n\nShe added that Venezuela \"will never again be a colony of any empire\" and attributed what she called a \"Zionist tint\" to the operation, describing it as \"really shameful.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez pointed to international support from governments in China, Russia, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, saying world leaders were shocked by the attack.\n\nPre-dawn assault\n\nThe assault, which occurred 36 years to the day after the 1990 US invasion of Panama that led to dictator Manuel Noriega's capture, unfolded before dawn as US forces disabled much of Caracas's electrical infrastructure. At least seven explosions rattled the capital over approximately 30 minutes, with blasts reported at military installations and civilian areas.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said American forces had rehearsed the manoeuvres for months, gathering detailed intelligence on Maduro's movements, routines and security arrangements.\n\nRodr\u00edguez reported Venezuelan civilian and military casualties without providing figures, whilst Trump acknowledged some US personnel were injured though none killed.\n\nTrump posted a photograph on social media showing Maduro blindfolded and wearing a tracksuit aboard the warship.\n\nThe Justice Department released a fresh indictment on Saturday charging Maduro and Flores with participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy, describing the administration as a \"corrupt, illegitimate government\" sustained by cocaine trafficking into the United States. Maduro was initially indicted on similar charges in 2020.\n\nThe operation triggered polarised responses on Venezuela's streets, with pro-government supporters gathering in Caracas to protest Maduro's detention whilst others celebrated. Armed civilians and militia members patrolled neighbourhoods long considered ruling party strongholds.\n\nVenezuelan state media reported citizens had mobilised following Maduro's earlier call for activation of the armed forces and Bolivarian militias.\n\nVenezuelan communities abroad also responded, with celebrations reported in the Chilean capital Santiago, Spanish capital Madrid and Doral, Florida, home to the largest Venezuelan diaspora in the United States.\n\nDecree of 'external commotion'\n\nRodr\u00edguez announced activation of a decree signed by Maduro declaring a state of \"external commotion,\" which has been delivered to the Supreme Court president for constitutional endorsement. The decree was expected to receive judicial approval within hours for immediate implementation.\n\nThe military action capped an intensive Trump administration pressure campaign that included a major deployment of American forces off South America's coast and attacks on vessels accused of drug smuggling. Last week, the CIA conducted what was believed to be the first direct strike on Venezuelan territory, targeting a docking facility allegedly used by drug cartels.\n\nTrump told the New York Post that no further troops would deploy to Venezuela \"if the vice president of Maduro does what we want,\" adding that US forces stood ready to launch \"a second wave of attacks much larger than the first.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the operation as a blow to Cuban intelligence and security services, which he said had effectively colonised Venezuela's security apparatus.\n\n\"If I were in Havana, I would be worried even a little bit,\" Rubio said, following Trump's suggestion that Cuba represented \"a very similar case\" for potential US intervention.\n\nTrump subsequently told the New York Post he had no plans for military action against Cuba, asserting the \"failed\" Communist-ruled island \"is going to fall on its own.\"\n\nUnder Venezuelan law, Rodr\u00edguez would constitutionally succeed Maduro as president. The 56-year-old Caracas native, daughter of leftist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, simultaneously holds the finance and oil ministry portfolios alongside her vice-presidential role, making her central to managing the country's struggling economy.\n\nMaduro has described Rodr\u00edguez as \"a tiger\" for her staunch defence of his socialist administration. She works closely with her brother Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, who heads the national assembly.\n\nState television continued broadcasting pro-Maduro programming despite earlier reports that Rodr\u00edguez was in Russia. Her exact whereabouts remained unclear, though state media reported she was in Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela's socialist ruling party has governed since 1999, when former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez assumed office promising to uplift the poor through what he termed a socialist revolution. Maduro, a former bus driver with little education and political experience, succeeded Ch\u00e1vez following his death in 2013 and presided over a decade of increasing authoritarian rule and economic crises which pushed nearly 8mn Venezuelans into exile.\n\nInternational observers widely dismissed Maduro's 2018 re-election as fraudulent due to major opposition parties being barred from participation. In the 2024 contest, electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared him victor hours after polls closed, though the opposition presented evidence, validated by multiple international organisations, suggesting he lost by more than two-to-one.",

But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n\"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" Trump told reporters of Rodr\u00edguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump's first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nIn a major snub, Trump said opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded last year's Nobel Peace Prize, didn't have the support to run the country.\n\nTrump said Rodr\u00edguez had a long conversation with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in which Trump claimed she said, \"'We'll do whatever you need.'\"\n\n\"I think she was quite gracious,\" Trump added. \"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez tried to project strength and unity among the ruling party's many factions, downplaying any hint of betrayal.

And the biggest beneficiary is going to be the people of Venezuela, and also, I can't stress this strongly enough, the people that got thrown out of Venezuela that are now in the United States.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56, is known as one of Maduro's closest allies, having held the top position in the country's information, foreign, and oil ministries. Rodr\u00edguez, described by Maduro as a \"tiger\" for her spirited defense of his socialist government, was next in line to succeed Maduro under Venezuela's constitution.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has not announced that Rodriguez was sworn in, and she could be in Russia, which has been a key ally to Maduro, according to Reuters, although Russian state media denied the report.\n\nVENEZUELANS POUR INTO STREETS TO CELEBRATE MADURO'S FALL\n\nIn her first public remarks on Trump's strikes against Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez demanded \"proof of life of President Nicolas Maduro and also the first lady Cilia Flores,\" from the U.S.\n\nVenezuela demands \"the respect of international law\" and condemned \"this complete brutal aggression against our people,\" Rodriguez said, according to TeleSUR English.\n\nThe former Venezuelan first couple is being escorted to New York, where they have been newly indicted and will stand trial, according to the Trump administration.\n\nMar\u00eda Corina Machado, known as Venezuela's leading political opposition to the Maduro regime, could be a top contender to replace Maduro. But Trump downplayed such hopes during his press briefing on Saturday. And Machado has called for 2024 presidential candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez to immediately assume power.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez is in exile in Spain after being widely considered by the U.S. and democratic allies as the legitimate leader in the election, which Maduro claimed he won.\n\nUS IS 'GOING TO RUN' VENEZUELA 'UNTIL A PROPER TRANSITION CAN TAKE PLACE': TRUMP\n\nTrump inferred following Maduro's capture that U.S. officials, including Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, would lead Venezuela during the transition period.\n\nWhen pressed on his relationship with Rodriguez and what role she would continue to play in the country, Trump said that Rubio \"is working on that directly.\"\n\n\"Just had a conversation with her, and she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again, very simple,\" he said.\n\nWHAT IS THE DELTA FORCE? THE US MILITARY UNIT BEHIND THE VENEZUELA RAID TOPPLING MADURO\n\nWhen pressed on why \"running a country in South America is America first,\" Trump replied he believes it is important for the U.S. \"to surround ourselves with good neighbors.\"\n\n\"We want to surround ourselves with stability. We want to surround ourselves with energy. We have tremendous energy in that country. It's very important that we protect it. We need that for ourselves. We need that for the world,\" he told reporters at Mar-a-Lago.",

      "title": "Venezuelan VP Calls for Maduro's Return, Defying Claim From Trump",
      "body": "President Donald Trump said the US will work with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez to transition to a democratically elected government after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture early Saturday, but she and other regime leaders have thus far appeared uncooperative.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio had a lengthy conversation with Rodr\u00edguez and she has agreed to help, Trump said in a news conference in Palm Beach, Florida. He claimed she had already been sworn in as president to succeed Maduro. \"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again, very simple,\" he said.\n\nMinutes later, in an appearance on state television surrounded by military brass, Rodr\u00edguez called for Maduro's return from US custody, describing his capture as \"barbaric\" and a \"kidnapping,\" and saying Maduro is the country's only president.\n\nIf Rodr\u00edguez is a willing partner, she could help the US ease a transition by maintaining stability with the current institutions in Venezuela. But her long allegiance to Maduro, who is widely viewed as having stolen last year's election, is likely to raise questions about whether she is willing to cede power -- and whether the US is seriously committed to regime change in the South American nation.\n\nRodr\u00edguez didn't respond to requests for comment. On TV, she said that a congressional chamber was preparing an emergency decree, which could offer clues as to how the government plans to operate without Maduro. She also said Venezuela could still have \"respectful relationships,\" perhaps offering a path to a detente with the US.\n\nRodr\u00edguez is considered by many as the most powerful person in the country after Maduro. She is one of his closest allies, rising through the ranks in roles such as information and foreign minister, and was named oil minister in 2024 after the contested presidential vote.\n\nTrump didn't commit to sending US troops to aid in a transition, saying only that his government would help ensure oil infrastructure was protected and improved. He dismissed the idea of installing opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, calling her a \"nice woman\" who doesn't have the support of the Venezuelan people.\n\nTrump's remarks contrasted with the defiant tone from government officials in Venezuela Saturday morning. State television alternated archival footage of Maduro calling for peace \"with dignity\" with statements of support from international allies, and remarks from regional military and civilian leaders rejecting what they described as an attack on the country. Officials repeatedly insisted that Venezuela remained calm, pledged loyalty to Maduro and his socialist agenda, and demanded proof that Maduro was alive.\n\n\"We pledged loyalty many years ago, and today more than ever we will defend it firmly and completely,\" said a person identified on state TV as an official from Yaracuy state. Addressing a crowd of soldiers and civilians, the official asked, \"How is morale?\" The crowd replied in unison: \"High. Long live Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\"\n\nTrump, on the other hand, said the military would need to fall in line.\n\n\"All political and military figures in Venezuela should understand what happened to Maduro can happen to them, and it will happen to them\" if they weren't \"fair\" to the Venezuelan people, he said.\n\nRodr\u00edguez talked Saturday to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose country was among the Venezuela allies that condemned Maduro's capture by US forces.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56, has played a key role in the nation's budget planning and has led diplomatic outreach to consolidate alliances with some of Venezuela's biggest allies, including China and Russia. She recently pressed China to increase purchases of Venezuelan oil and provide diluents needed to keep shipments flowing amid US sanctions.\n\nShe began her political career under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez after graduating as a lawyer from the Central University of Venezuela. Her father, Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, was a prominent figure on the Venezuelan radical left in the 1960s and 1970s and the founder of a Marxist party. He died in 1976 under interrogation in prison after being tortured by state security forces, an event that became a defining part of Delcy's political narrative.\n\nThose who have worked alongside Rodr\u00edguez often remark on her long hours, with Maduro recently saying she responded to messages well into the night and early morning.\n\nLoyal Ally\n\nAlongside Rodr\u00edguez Saturday were the heads of the legislative branch, her brother Jorge Rodr\u00edguez; the judicial branch, Caryslia Rodr\u00edguez, and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez.\n\nJorge Rodr\u00edguez is another key figure in the regime as head of the National Assembly and one of Maduro's closest advisers. The 60-year old psychiatrist became politically active in college, where he was a student leader, and after graduation, he transitioned into government roles.\n\nA loyal ally of Ch\u00e1vez and his successor Maduro, he's held several high-profile political posts, serving as vice president, communications minister and head of the electoral authority. He's also acted as negotiator for the Maduro government in several rounds of talks with the US and the country's opposition.\n\nDespite his mediator role, Rodr\u00edguez is also known for his explosive temperament, lashing out in Congress and publicly threatening and insulting members of the opposition.\n\nJorge Rodr\u00edguez would be a key figure in ensuring continuity and political unity within the ruling party. He was re-elected as a legislator in May 2025 and was expected to take office on Jan. 5.\n\nMilitary Man\n\nAmid rumors that his home had been attacked and that he had been killed, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, 62, was the first senior government official to appear in a video on social media, more than three hours after the unrest began. In the message, he urged Venezuelans to remain calm, backed President Maduro's declaration of a state of emergency, and said national defense measures would be activated to restore order and stability.\n\nPadrino has been Venezuela's defense minister since October 2014, making him one of the longest-serving officials in the government. He was appointed during a tense period marked by large anti-government protests, when Maduro was seeking to strengthen control over the armed forces and secure loyalty at the highest levels. A career army officer trained in Venezuela's traditional military system, Padrino was seen as a figure capable of keeping the military united as the country's political and economic crisis worsened.\n\nDuring Padrino's time in office, the armed forces have taken on roles far beyond national defense. The military now oversees important parts of the economy, including food distribution, ports, mining, and oil-related logistics. This expansion has tied senior officers more closely to the government's survival, giving the military a direct stake in maintaining the current political system.\n\nFollow the latest in global politics.\n\nFollow the latest in global politics.\n\nFollow the latest in global politics.\n\nGet insights from reporters around the world in the Balance of Power newsletter.\n\nGet insights from reporters around the world in the Balance of Power newsletter.\n\nGet insights from reporters around the world in the Balance of Power newsletter.\n\nBloomberg may send me offers and promotions.\n\nPlus Signed UpPlus Sign UpPlus Sign Up\n\nBy submitting my information, I agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.\n\nPadrino has consistently supported Maduro during major moments of unrest, including the 2017 protests, the 2019 challenge following international recognition of Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president, and repeated reports of unrest within the military. He has been sanctioned by the US and other governments, which accuse him of backing authoritarian rule, human rights abuses, and corruption. The US has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture.\n\nVenezuela's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, also appeared on state television early Saturday to urge calm and call for international attention to what he called attacks on areas inhabited by civilians.\n\n\"What they tried to do with bombs and missiles, they achieved partially,\" he said, questioning whether the international community would \"become accomplices to this massacre.\"\n\nCoup Participant\n\nCabello, 62, is the government's socialist party strongman, controlling loyalists and followers across the country, as well as heading prisons, police and intelligence forces, which the United Nations has said enabled crimes against humanity.\n\nAs an army lieutenant, Cabello was part of a handful of young officials led by Ch\u00e1vez responsible for a 1992 coup attempt. After Ch\u00e1vez was elected president, Cabello was appointed to key posts, including minister of housing and telecommunications, head of the National Assembly, and governor of Miranda state.\n\nCabello was a key figure in furthering government controls over the free press and the persecution of politicians, journalists and human rights activists. The US accused Cabello of narco-trafficking and terrorism in 2018. He's charged in a Southern District of New York federal indictment with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism. In 2025 the State Department announced it was raising a reward for information leading to Cabello's capture to as much as $25 million.",

One by one, she introduced figures seated beside her as she asserted that Maduro remains Venezuela's rightful president.\n\n\"There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros,\" Rodr\u00edguez declared to applause, a statement that directly contradicted remarks made earlier by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nHours earlier, Trump held a press conference alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, celebrating Maduro's removal during a pre-dawn U.S. military strike in Caracas. During questioning, Trump claimed that Rubio had spoken with Rodr\u00edguez, that she had been sworn in as president, and that she was willing to cooperate with the United States as it planned to oversee Venezuela's transition and reopen its oil and gas sector to U.S. companies.\n\nTrump said the U.S. intended to extract Venezuela's energy resources to benefit what he called the \"oppressed Venezuelan people\" and to compensate American oil companies forced out under the Maduro government.\n\nRodr\u00edguez sharply rejected that narrative. In her address, she accused Washington of seeking regime change in order to seize Venezuela's natural wealth.\n\n\"With this invasion, the masks have fallen off,\" she said. \"It reveals a single objective, regime change in Venezuela. This regime change would allow for the seizure of our energy, mineral and natural resources. This is the true objective, and the world and the international community must know it.\"\n\nShe warned that the U.S. action had inflicted \"a terrible stain\" on bilateral relations and framed the military operation as a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty, calling on the international community to condemn what she described as imperial aggression.",

      "title": "Who is Delcy Rodr\u00edguez? The Finance czar and Maduro loyalist Trump says is Venezuela's new president",
      "body": "Rodr\u00edguez, Maduro's loyalist VP, oversees key oil and finance roles\n\nWhen President Donald Trump told reporters that Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, had been 'just sworn in' as president after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's alleged capture, he didn't just float a name, he dropped the most obvious succession figure in Venezuela's ruling structure into the middle of a fast-moving crisis.\n\nThe problem: Venezuela's government has not confirmed any swearing-in, and reporting about Rodr\u00edguez's whereabouts has been contradictory, including Reuters citing multiple sources who said she was in Russia even as Moscow's state media denied it.\n\nHere's what we know about Rodr\u00edguez, and why she matters.\n\nA Maduro loyalist with a 'tiger' reputation\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56, is one of Maduro's most trusted and combative allies. Maduro has called her a 'tiger,' reflecting her reputation as a hardline defender of his socialist government and its survival-first political instincts.\n\nShe works closely with her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, a key power broker who leads Venezuela's National Assembly.\n\nHer family roots run deep in Venezuela's revolutionary politics\n\nRodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a left-wing guerrilla figure who founded the revolutionary Liga Socialista party in the 1970s, background that has long shaped how the Rodr\u00edguez family brands itself inside chavismo: revolutionary pedigree, high tolerance for confrontation.\n\nLawyer, messenger, enforcer: how she rose fast\n\nRodr\u00edguez is a lawyer who graduated from the Universidad Central de Venezuela. She moved through high-profile government roles over the past decade, including:\n\nCommunication and Information Minister (2013-2014)\n\nForeign Minister (2014-2017), where she became one of the regime's international faces, aggressive in tone, unapologetic about Venezuela's direction.\n\nA senior role in the pro-government Constituent Assembly, the body that expanded Maduro's powers during Venezuela's political crisis years.\n\nVice President (from 2018), appointed by Maduro as part of a reshuffle after a widely criticised election period.\n\nThe economic operator: finance + oil, at the same time\n\nWhat makes Rodr\u00edguez more than a standard political loyalist is that she has also been an economic manager.\n\nReuters reports she has simultaneously held senior roles tied to finance and oil alongside the vice presidency, a combination that gave her major influence over Venezuela's sanctions-hit economy and the private sector that still functions around it.\n\nIn August 2024, Maduro added the oil ministry to her portfolio, tasking her with managing escalating US sanctions pressure on Venezuela's most important industry.\n\nThe key contradiction: Trump says she's in, she's demanding proof of life\n\nTrump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in touch with Rodr\u00edguez and portrayed her as willing to cooperate with Washington's 'transition.'\n\nBut Reuters reported that on Saturday, an audio message attributed to Rodr\u00edguez was played on Venezuelan state television demanding proof of life for Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, a posture that reads like defiance, not coordination.\n\nThat's the core tension: Trump cast her as Maduro's replacement; her public message, as reported, cast the US claim as an attack requiring proof and accountability.\n\nWhy her name is the succession peg, even if the 'sworn in' claim is disputed\n\nIn any system built around a dominant leader, the deputy becomes the default answer when the leader disappears. Rodr\u00edguez is that default, not because she is universally popular, but because she sits at the intersection of:\n\n* political loyalty (inner circle),\n\n* institutional continuity (vice presidency), and\n\n* economic control (oil and finance portfolios).\n\nIn other words: if the regime needs a face to project continuity, Rodr\u00edguez is the person who can plausibly do it.",

      "title": "Trump Claims Venezuela's VP Has Been 'Sworn In' to Replace Maduro as Uncertainty Deepens",
      "body": "US President Donald Trump has claimed that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, has been \"sworn in\" as the country's new president following the dramatic capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by US forces, a development that has thrown Venezuela and the wider region into deep political uncertainty.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Saturday, Trump said Rodr\u00edguez had assumed office in the wake of what his administration describes as a US military operation that led to the arrest of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. According to Trump, the transition was part of what he called an effort to \"stabilise Venezuela and begin a proper transition away from years of corruption and failure.\"\n\n\"There is now new leadership in Venezuela,\" Trump said. \"The vice president has been sworn in, and discussions are ongoing about what is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"\n\nHowever, there has been no confirmation from Venezuelan state media, government institutions, or independent sources that Rodr\u00edguez has been sworn in or that any constitutional transfer of power has taken place. Her current whereabouts are also unknown, adding to speculation and confusion surrounding Trump's announcement.\n\nUnder Venezuela's constitution, the removal or incapacity of a sitting president triggers a clearly defined succession process involving the National Assembly and the Supreme Tribunal of Justice. Neither institution has issued a statement confirming Maduro's removal from office or Rodr\u00edguez's installation as president.\n\nOpposition figures inside Venezuela, many of whom have long opposed Maduro, have also expressed caution. Some warned that any leadership change imposed externally would lack legitimacy and risk plunging the country into further instability.\n\n\"This is not how constitutional transitions happen,\" said one opposition lawmaker, speaking anonymously due to security concerns. \"Venezuela cannot be governed by press conferences in Florida or Washington.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez has been one of the most influential figures in Venezuela's government for more than a decade. A former foreign minister, she has played a central role in managing the country's battered economy amid sweeping US sanctions, currency collapse, and chronic shortages.\n\nThe daughter of Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a left-wing guerrilla fighter who died in police custody in the 1970s, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez rose through the ranks of Venezuela's political elite alongside her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, now president of the National Assembly. She is widely regarded as a disciplined, hardline loyalist of the Bolivarian revolution, though also a pragmatic operator in negotiations with foreign actors.\n\nTrump claimed that Rodr\u00edguez had spoken directly with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and had signalled a willingness to cooperate with Washington. \"She understands what needs to be done,\" Trump said, without providing details of any agreement.\n\nLegal experts, regional leaders, and human rights organisations have condemned the US operation that led to Maduro's capture, describing it as a violation of international law and Venezuelan sovereignty.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva earlier warned that forcibly removing leaders sets a dangerous precedent. \"This opens the door to a world where might replaces law,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nThe United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, Ben Saul, also criticised what he described as the \"illegal abduction\" of a sitting head of state, calling for immediate clarification of Maduro's legal status and access to due process.\n\nTrump's claim of a new Venezuelan leadership has heightened anxiety across Latin America, particularly in Cuba, which relies heavily on Venezuelan oil supplies. Analysts warn that any abrupt political shift in Caracas could deepen humanitarian crises and destabilise already fragile economies.\n\nUS officials have not clarified whether Washington recognises Rodr\u00edguez as Venezuela's legitimate leader or whether a US-administered interim authority remains in place, as Trump earlier suggested the United States would \"run the country\" until a transition is completed.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, key questions remain unresolved:\n\nUntil those questions are answered, Venezuela appears caught in a dangerous political limbo -- one shaped less by domestic processes than by extraordinary external intervention.\n\nMore developments are expected in the coming hours.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Editor's Note: For content partnerships and collaborations, reach out via editor@naija247news.com\n\nReporting by David Okoroafor, News Writer in Lagos, Nigeria.",

The split locations of top officials have deepened uncertainty about who is exercising executive authority inside the country.\n\nRodr\u00edguez appeared earlier Saturday in an audio message aired on state television demanding proof of life for Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Jorge Rodr\u00edguez has not made a public appearance since the U.S. operation, further clouding the question of succession.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, President Donald Trump said the United States will effectively \"run\" Venezuela following the operation. When asked whether the U.S. presence could become an extended stay, Trump said it would not cost the United States anything and that American forces would remain in the country \"as long as we feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe comments suggest a potentially prolonged U.S. role in Venezuela at a moment when the country's constitutional leadership structure appears unclear. With senior officials either abroad or silent and U.S. forces asserting control, it remains unresolved who Venezuela's next president is -- and where that authority is being exercised.",

Trump said Washington would place Venezuela under temporary US control, including the possible deployment of American forces.\n\n\"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump said during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. \"We can't take a chance that someone else takes over Venezuela who doesn't have the interests of Venezuelans in mind.\"\n\nTrump added that US oil companies would be sent into the country, even as an embargo on \"all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect.\"\n\n\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,\" Trump said.\n\nAlso Read: US strikes on Venezuela LIVE: Trump shares 1st pic of 'captured' Maduro, says US will run Venezuela for now\n\nTrump said Maduro and his wife were being transported by ship to New York to face indictments on alleged drug trafficking, weapons, and conspiracy charges.\n\nHe also released what he described as the first image of Maduro following his capture, claiming it was taken aboard the USS Iwo Jima as Maduro was being taken to New York City.\n\nTrump said Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez had been \"just sworn in\" as Venezuela's new president following Maduro's capture.\n\nHowever, the Venezuelan government has made no announcement confirming that Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in.\n\nSeveral sources also told Reuters that Rodr\u00edguez was in Russia at the time, though Russia's state news agency denied those reports, calling them \"fake.\"\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Rodr\u00edguez demanded that the United States provide \"proof of life\" for Maduro and his wife. Her comments were broadcast in an audio message aired on Venezuelan state television, following Trump's claim that the pair had been captured by US forces.",

      "title": "With Maduro in US custody, who governs in Venezuela?",
      "body": "With disbelief, shock, and confusion, after more than 20 weeks of political tension, Venezuela awoke to the news of the arrest of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, following a combined military operation by U.S. forces in Caracas. The question now is what will happen to Chavismo and who will assume power.\n\nWith Maduro and Flores detained, the 1999 Constitution stipulates that the vice president, in this case Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, a close confidante of the president, assumes the reins of the executive branch. Her brother Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, president of the National Assembly, is third in the line of succession. Diosdado Cabello, the country's second most powerful figure, would retain his position as Minister of the Interior and guardian of the pro-government civilian-military establishment.\n\nThe whereabouts of Delcy Rodr\u00edguez are unclear after Reuters reported that she was in Russia. The New York Times, however, reported hours later that she was in Caracas.\n\nThe silence of the early morning was shattered suddenly and unexpectedly around 2:00 a.m. in Caracas -- and also in the states of Aragua, Miranda, and La Guaira. This is the first foreign military aggression in the history of the country. Details regarding the number of casualties are not yet available. The operation targeted key locations of the Chavista regime's civilian-military power base. According to initial reports, the attacks included the famous Mountain Barracks, formerly the Military History Museum, in the west of the city, where Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's remains are interred.\n\nDespite Maduro's capture, the Chavista regime has yet to show any signs of cracking. The Bolivarian Revolution is deeply entrenched in the Venezuelan state, a situation that transcends Maduro's presence in Miraflores Palace.\n\nOn the streets of Caracas, disbelief, caution, and fear prevail: the memory of the military repression of recent years is still very much alive. In the cities of the interior, there is calm. Security forces are gradually taking to the streets. The most outspoken members of the ruling party appeared in the early hours to condemn the announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump, demand news about Maduro's whereabouts, and denounce violations of international law and national sovereignty.\n\nThe issue currently obsessing Chavista militants is the whereabouts of Maduro and Flores. Vice President Rodr\u00edguez demanded information about the fate of the president and his wife, and asked Trump for \"immediate proof of life.\" The Republican later published a photograph of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima on his social media platform, Truth. Rodr\u00edguez, like other Chavista leaders, has implied that the Chavista regime is fully aware of what it must do to guarantee territorial integrity and the presence of the revolutionary leadership in power. A State of Internal Disturbance has already been declared, a measure that will militarize daily life and have clear consequences for the nation. Rodr\u00edguez emphasized that Maduro \"has given very clear instructions to the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, so that, in perfect civic-military, popular, and police unity, all plans for the defense of the nation are activated.\"\n\nAt the crack of dawn, Diosdado Cabello, the regime's second-in-command, appeared on state-run Venezolana de Televisi\u00f3n, clad in tactical vest and helmet and surrounded by members of the political police. Cabello called the U.S. attack \"treacherous and vile\" and urged his supporters \"not to lose their composure, to avoid despair.\" \"Avoid situations that favor the invading enemy,\" he said. Cabello questioned the role of \"international organizations\" in this crisis, accusing them of being \"complicit in a massacre of civilians.\" The leader addressed his men on camera with the two central slogans of the regime's security forces: \"Always loyal, never traitors\" and \"To doubt is treason.\"\n\nVladimir Padrino, Minister of Defense and a key figure in the Bolivarian Revolution, denounced Washington's explicit intention to \"provoke regime change\" and described the events as \"the most serious outrage in our entire history.\" Padrino called for calm among the citizens and asked them to trust the Armed Forces. \"Faced with this vile and cowardly attack, which threatens the peace and stability of the region, we issue the strongest possible condemnation to the international community so that the U.S. government is held accountable,\" he said. Padrino confirmed the deployment of all the country's military forces within the territory.\n\nBoth Venezuelan Foreign Minister Iv\u00e1n Gil and Attorney General Tarek William Saab called on the international community to expressly condemn the military attack perpetrated against the country. Gil demanded \"an immediate statement from the UN Security Council.\" Saab denounced that \"many innocent civilians have been killed in this hour. This threat of bloodshed has materialized. I call on the people to be vigilant, and I call on the country's prosecutors to be attentive to the consequences of these cowardly attacks.\"\n\nThe segments of the Venezuelan political opposition that are still tolerated within the country have, so far, maintained a prudent silence. In exile, however, the situation has been different. Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, the recent Nobel Peace Prize laureate, stated in a lengthy communiqu\u00e9 that they are ready to seize power. \"We are going to restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional country, and bring our children home,\" the opposition leader promised, adding that she will announce the next steps of her movement through her official social media accounts.",

      "body": "Nicolas Maduro, center, his wife Cilia Flores, left, and Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's vice president, right, in Caracas in 2024. (Source: Bloomberg)\n\nWith Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in US custody, his top lieutenants quickly took to social media and state television early Saturday to fill the power vacuum, taking a defiant stand against the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News Saturday that the US is reviewing what a transition of power will look like in Venezuela. Meanwhile, the regime's most prominent leaders were already asserting their authority over their nation's military and government.\n\nThe key for Maduro's inner circle to maintain control will be to retain the loyalty of the nation's armed forces. Thus far there has been no sign of dissent in the ranks, and the streets of Caracas were quiet early Saturday as Venezuelans waited cautiously to see what would happen next.\n\nVice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez would be next in line to succeed Maduro under Venezuela's constitution. She spoke by phone with state television Saturday, calling for national unity and rejecting foreign interference, and talked to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Her current whereabouts haven't been disclosed, and the Russian government said a report that she was in Russia was false.\n\n\"They have a vice president as you know,\" Trump told Fox, when asked who would succeed Maduro. He said he would also consider whether opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado should be in charge. The objective would be to avoid a situation where the US has to remove another leader, Trump said.\n\n\"We can't take a chance after having done this incredible thing last night of letting somebody else take over, where we have to do it again,\" he said.\n\nMachado, for her part, said the candidate she backed in last year's election, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, should immediately assume power, and called on the armed forces to back him. But Gonz\u00e1lez has been in exile in Spain, and Machado has yet to return to Venezuela after traveling to Sweden last month to accept her Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nRodr\u00edguez is considered by many as the most powerful person in the country after Maduro. She is one of his closest allies, rising through the ranks in roles such as information and foreign minister, and was named oil minister in 2024 after the contested presidential vote.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56, has played a key role in the nation's budget planning and has led diplomatic outreach to consolidate alliances with some of Venezuela's biggest allies, including China and Russia. She recently pressed China to increase purchases of Venezuelan oil and provide diluents needed to keep shipments flowing amid US sanctions.\n\nShe began her political career under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez after graduating as a lawyer from the Central University of Venezuela. Her father, Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, was a prominent figure on the Venezuelan radical left in the 1960s and 1970s and the founder of a Marxist party. He died in 1976 under interrogation in prison after being tortured by state security forces, an event that became a defining part of Delcy's political narrative.\n\nThose who have worked alongside Rodr\u00edguez often remark on her long hours, with Maduro recently saying she responded to messages well into the night and early morning.",

Speaking by phone with state-run broadcaster VTV, Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez said the regime had lost contact with both Maduro and Flores and demanded that Washington provide what she called \"proof of life,\" an extraordinary on-air concession from a government that has long projected absolute control.\n\n\"In light of this brutal situation and this brutal attack, we do not know the whereabouts of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores,\" Rodr\u00edguez said during the broadcast, accusing the United States of having \"violated, attacked, and assaulted\" Venezuela. She repeatedly pressed the Trump administration to account for Maduro and Flores, framing the operation as an act of aggression rather than addressing the disappearance itself. Rodr\u00edguez went on to claim Maduro had warned Venezuelans such an operation could happen, blaming what she described as American \"energy greed\" for the strike.\n\nReuters is reporting that the Venezuelan VP is in Russia, according to four sources.\n\nPosted by: Bulg",

The attack included the capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores, who are reportedly being transported to face criminal charges in the US.\n\nWitnesses reported at least seven explosions in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, around 4:30 AM on Saturday. The attack lasted less than 30 minutes. Casualty reports were not immediately available.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration has since banned US commercial flights over Venezuelan airspace because of \"ongoing military activity.\" President Trump stated that additional details are to come on the matter and that he will hold a news conference at 11:00 AM.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez condemned the act, stating it constitutes a flagrant violation of the UN Charter and threatens international peace and stability. Vice President Rodr\u00edguez also said that her government does not know the whereabouts of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores, demanding that the US government provide proof of life.\n\nPresident Maduro and First Lady Flores will reportedly face criminal charges. In 2020, Maduro and 14 other government officials were indicted in the Southern District of New York for what then-US Attorney General William Barr said was conspiring with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and \"causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities.\"\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said the attack and capture of Maduro marks \"[a] new dawn for Venezuela,\" claiming that \"[t]he tyrant is gone.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry condemned what it called a US \"act of armed aggression,\" stating that \"Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, outside intervention.\" Russia also agreed with calls for an emergency UN Security Council meeting. US Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted his concerns on X, stating, \"I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.\"\n\nThis morning's attacks come after a long series of attacks on Venezuelan boats by the US military. As of Friday, the number of known boat strikes was 35, and the number of people killed was at least 115, according to the Trump administration. Tensions have steadily built between the two nations. The US announced sanctions against four oil companies operating in Venezuela on Wednesday. There have also been legal disputes over due process for Venezuelan migrants and allegations that Venezuelans who were deported to El Salvador by the US were tortured.",

We differ in every aspect,\" Ahmad wrote.\n\n\"So how does a sitting president get captured just like that, in his own nation?\"\n\nHis remarks followed an announcement by former United States President, Donald Trump, who claimed that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been taken into custody.\n\nIn response, Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, demanded that the United States present proof that Maduro is alive.\n\nShe also disclosed that she currently has no information regarding the whereabouts of the president and his wife.\n\nRodr\u00edguez made the demand during a telephone interview with Venezuelan television, coming shortly after reports of US military strikes in the country.",

This event is receiving substantial media coverage (53 articles from 48 sources) and is overwhelmingly viewed negatively (-0.52 average sentiment score), suggesting widespread condemnation or concern. The situation is further complicated by the unclear status of leadership, with Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez asserting Maduro\u2019s continued presidency while simultaneously engaging in dialogue with US representatives. \n\nThe key stakeholders exhibit conflicting positions. Donald Trump confirms the US operation and Maduro\u2019s capture, while also suggesting potential cooperation with Delcy Rodr\u00edguez to \u201cmake Venezuela great again.\u201d Delcy Rodr\u00edguez condemns the US actions as a violation of international law and demands proof of life for Maduro and Flores, yet also appears open to dialogue. The event has significant financial implications, with US oil companies poised to invest billions in Venezuela\u2019s vast crude oil reserves (303,000,000,000 barrels), potentially extracting USD 1,000,000,000 while also taking USD 1,000,000,000 out of the country.",
