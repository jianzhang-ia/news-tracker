      "title": "Venezuelans face uncertainty as the Trump administration's plans for their country emerge. Here's what to know",
      "body": "(CNN) -- An emboldened President Donald Trump declared Sunday night that the US is \"in charge\" of Venezuela after detaining President Nicolas Maduro in a military raid over the weekend, as he issued stark warnings to other countries that they could be next.\n\nMaduro, who was dragged into custody with his wife, Cilia Flores, in a deadly early Saturday morning raid, is slated to appear in court for the first time at noon ET in New York City to face charges that he and his associates conspired with narcoterrorists to ship thousands of tons of cocaine to the US.\n\nTrump's latest comments come even as some in his administration, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, suggested the US would be relying more on leverage over Venezuela and coercion, rather than directly running it as Trump first suggested during a Saturday morning news conference.\n\nMeanwhile, Venezuelans are hunkering down as they wait for more information about what the Trump administration has in store for their country. The Trump administration is working quickly to establish a compliant interim government, according to US officials, prioritizing administrative stability and repairing the country's oil infrastructure over an immediate turn to democracy.\n\nIn particular, US officials have focused on the country's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who Trump advisers identified weeks ago as a viable, if nonpermanent, alternative to Maduro. Despite Rodr\u00edguez's initial attacks on the administration over Maduro's capture, US officials privately maintained optimism she would work with the United States.\n\nBy Sunday night, Rodr\u00edguez was striking a softer tone than she previously had, calling for \"cooperation\" with the US.\n\nTrump returned to Washington, DC, late Sunday night, where lawmakers are mostly divided along party lines in their reaction to the military operation, which Congress was not notified about ahead of time.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have slammed the administration for not seeking congressional authorization before the attack, while Trump allies in the GOP have mostly praised the operation.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican, told CNN on \"State of the Union\" that new \"legitimate\" elections including members of the country's opposition party will likely be a next step.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nWhat happened during the military operation?\n\nThe Trump administration struck various parts of Caracas, Venezuela's capital city, in the early hours of Saturday, January 3. Members of the US Army's elite Delta Force dragged Maduro and Flores from their bedroom and flew them to the USS Iwo Jima, then onto New York, via Guantanamo Bay.\n\nThe operation took months of planning and was the culmination of a pressure campaign on Maduro that has featured a massive US naval buildup in the Caribbean and a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers.\n\nTrump's pressure campaign on Maduro has included strikes destroying more than 30 boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean in what the US has described as a counter-narcotics campaign. Trump last month ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers coming to and leaving Venezuela, and the US has seized multiple vessels since the announcement.\n\nWhat is up with Venezuela's oil?\n\nRubio rejected accusations on Sunday that the operation was conducted in order to give US companies better access to Venezuela's oil reserves, which are the largest proven in the world. Still, he predicted there will be \"dramatic interest\" from Western oil companies on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nCNN reported Sunday, however, that energy companies have been privately wary of committing to the endeavor, according to multiple sources familiar with the conversations. Experts and members of Venezuela's opposition say that the oil industry cannot be revitalized without political stability.\n\nVenezuela's reserves consist of heavy, sour crude oil, which requires special equipment and a high level of technical prowess to produce. Products made in the refining process include diesel, asphalt and fuels for factories and other heavy equipment.\n\nVenezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company PDVSA says its pipelines haven't been updated in 50 years, and the cost to update the infrastructure to return to peak production levels would cost $58 billion.\n\nIn recent weeks, members of the Venezuela opposition briefed Trump administration officials on their plans to revitalize the oil sector in Venezuela in the event of Maduro's ouster, according to two sources familiar with the interaction. But now, opposition members are wary of what the Trump administration is planning because they do not want remaining members of the Maduro regime to lead the country or any efforts to rebuild the country's oil industry.\n\nWho is in charge in Venezuela?\n\nTrump said during a news conference after the operation that the US would \"run\" the country \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\" Later Sunday, Rubio appeared to clarify those comments, saying that the administration's focus is on setting future policy.\n\n\"It's running policy,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" adding that the \"entire national security apparatus\" will be involved in those decisions.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, a Maduro loyalist, assumed the powers and duties of acting president on Sunday. While Rodr\u00edguez initially slammed the operation and demanded the US release Maduro and his wife, she later extended an invitation to the US government to collaborate on an \"agenda of cooperation.\"\n\n\"President Donald Trump: our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war. This has always been President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's message, and it is a message of all Venezuela right now,\" Rodr\u00edguez said in comments made directly to the US president.\n\nThe Trump administration has shrugged off calls to support the leader of Venezuela's opposition, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, and the president said Saturday that he didn't believe the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner has the \"respect\" or \"support\" to lead the country.\n\nTrump told the New York Post Sunday that Machado would only win an election if she had his support, adding that \"I like her very much.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Venezuelan opposition politician David Smolansky pushed back on Trump's suggestion that Machado lacks support at home, calling her \"the most trusted leader in Venezuela.\"\n\nHe pointed to her landslide primary victory and her backing of president-elect Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as proof of her legitimacy.\n\nThe opposition maintains that Gonz\u00e1lez was the true winner of the 2024 elections, and on Sunday he referred to himself as \"president\" and called for the Venezuela's military to put him in power.\n\n\"As commander in chief, I remind you that your loyalty is to the constitution, to the people and to the republic,\" Gonz\u00e1lez said. \"This is a historic moment. We face it with calm, clarity and democratic commitment.\"\n\nWhat about other countries in the region?\n\nTrump threatened other countries on Sunday and implied military action could come to Colombia.\n\n\"Colombia is very sick too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nTrump also touched on Mexico, noting that he repeatedly offered the assistance of US troops to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, but that \"she's a little afraid.\"\n\nHe also repeated comments he had made about Cuba on Saturday, noting that he is not considering military action against Cuba, and that he believed that it would fall of its own volition.\n\n\"I think it's just going to fall. I don't think we need any action,\" he said Sunday.\n\nCuba's President Miguel Diaz Canel has condemned the US operation and has called it \"state terrorism against the brave Venezuelan people and against Our America.\" The country said Sunday that at least 32 of its nationals were killed in the attack.\n\nTo the north, Trump renewed his interest in acquiring Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark - a NATO ally - that he says the US \"absolutely\" needs for \"national security.\" The Danish prime minister urged Trump to tone down his rhetoric, saying the US had no right to annex the island.\n\nHow are Venezuelans dealing with the fall out of the military operation?\n\nCNN reported over the weekend that the streets of Caracas and other cities have been quiet, with people only venturing out to for basic supplies in case the capital sees clashes or looting.\n\nThere have been little signs of the government-backed paramilitary groups known as colectivos on the streets, but long lines outside of supermarkets and pharmacies.\n\nOpposition supporters are celebrating in private, and there have been no rallies supporting the US action. State media in Venezuela has featured supporters of the regime with defiant messages for Trump.\n\nCNN's Ali Main, Kit Maher, Kevin Liptak, Jennifer Hansler, Kristen Holmes, Tim Lister, Eric Bradner, and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2026 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

      "title": "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez assumes interim presidency of Venezuela after Maduro's capture and opens the door to negotiations with the United States",
      "body": "The Supreme Court will order her appointment to 'ensure continuity' in the nation and she is expected to be sworn in on Monday, becoming the first woman to lead Venezuela\n\nThe capture and transfer to New York of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by the United States last Saturday has precipitated a political earthquake in the Caribbean nation that has positioned Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, until now vice-president, as the first female interim president of a country under military, diplomatic and constitutional pressure.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez in power\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez will probably become the interim president today, Monday, so that things remain as they are, not so that they change. Her position serves to give Chavismo the image that everything is still in order and that the government is in control, in one of the most difficult and important contexts in Venezuelan politics.\n\nHowever, it is expected that she will be sworn into office and that the support of the institutions will give her strength within the country, although the decision is generating divided opinions in the international arena. It should be remembered, however, that Rodr\u00edguez 'is not new to this' and already had a lot of power within the government.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez is one of the most important figures in Chavismo today. She has been Foreign Secretary, has managed the economy and oil, and has been key in Maduro's government.\n\nIn recent years, she has come to have more power than the detained president himself. Her rise is not coincidental, but the result of accumulating power, loyalties and control of strategic areas of the state.\n\nWhat does the law say in Venezuela?\n\nIn the absence of power, the Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) ordered the application of Articles 233 and 234 of the Venezuelan Constitution. These articles clarify all possible scenarios in the event that the president is absent for a period of time or is no longer able to govern, specifying who would be granted the opportunity to take control of the government and how this would be done.\n\nBut to do so, it is first important to understand the law: if the president is absent for a period of time, which is foreseeable, someone must replace him, but only for that period of time. However, if he is no longer able to govern de facto, Venezuelan law states that elections must be called. In this way, Chavismo, using the TSJ, ensures that it manages the timing so that its power does not suddenly collapse.\n\nInternal crisis in Venezuela?\n\nThe Bolivarian Armed Forces have already publicly stated that they will support the decision of the TSJ. This is a fundamental fact in Venezuela, where military - and paramilitary - support is key to the functioning of a government.\n\nThe opposition is in an unprecedented situation, unable to do much in this new scenario. All this change is happening within Chavismo, and for now there is no one in the opposition with enough strength to compete for power, as pointed out by US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe future of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\n\nAlthough he has been arrested, Maduro remains a symbol for Chavismo. Rodr\u00edguez says he is the 'only legitimate president' and calls for his release, keeping his figure alive to unite the group.\n\nBut his time out of power diminishes his influence, so Chavismo will begin to reorganise without him as its main figure, using his detention as a political banner and as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the United States.\n\nCurrent outlook\n\nThe country is entering a period of forced change, with outside interference and Chavismo controlling everything from within. The Constitution states that there may be elections, but whether or not they take place depends more on political calculations than on legal deadlines.\n\nThe greatest danger is that there will be a controlled change that leaves power in the hands of another leader, but without any real change. The question is not only when there will be elections, but how and who will be able to truly compete.\n\nDespite the cheers, applause and shouts of joy heard from windows and balconies across the country, press correspondents from media outlets around the world noted that the feeling within the country is one of utter fear. This is why only a few dozen people across the country took to the streets, as Delcy Rodr\u00edguez had requested.\n\nFear of the motorised patrols of paramilitaries, which are common in the uprisings against the government in Venezuela, is the main cause of fear among Venezuelans, according to data from street interviews in the country's major cities.\n\nRelations with the United States and international reactions\n\nThe United States sees Delcy Rodr\u00edguez as the key person to talk to in this new phase. Donald Trump has made it clear that Washington wants to take the lead until there is a proper transition, which already marks an imbalance of power from the outset.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, for her part, talks about defending sovereignty, but also makes gestures of openness. The proposal for a 'cooperation agenda' reveals pragmatism and an awareness that the political survival of Chavismo depends on negotiating with those who currently hold the initiative.\n\nOther countries are watching this very new situation with caution. Venezuela's 'long-standing friends' are in a dilemma: should they support the current government, as the law dictates, or accept the new order imposed by the United States?\n\nSanctions, the recognition of governments and aid from other countries are once again the topic of conversation. Once again, Venezuela has become a chess game where the interests of the region and the entire world collide.\n\nKey national issues\n\nBeyond the individuals involved, the main problem is who controls what. The idea that the country is independent clashes with the direct intervention that changes the rules of the game for the Venezuelan government and all its allies.\n\nThe important question is not only who is in power, but who really decides how things go. Between Caracas and Washington, the near future of the country is being decided, with a change that seems less discussed than it appears publicly.",

      "title": "Venezuela Interim Leader Pledges Cooperation With US After Dropping Initial Tough Talk",
      "body": "Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez extended an invitation to the United States for cooperation on shared development, marking a shift from her earlier condemnation of the operation that captured Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Rodr\u00edguez, sworn in as interim leader by Venezuela's Supreme Court following Maduro's removal, posted a statement Sunday calling for a balanced and respectful relationship with Washington.\n\nThe message came after Rodr\u00edguez initially described the U.S. action as a barbaric kidnapping and violation of sovereignty. She stressed that Venezuela aspires to live without external threats and emphasized peace and dialogue over conflict. Rodr\u00edguez addressed President Trump directly, noting that Maduro's position had always favored dialogue and that this reflects the view of all Venezuelans now.\n\nPresident Trump responded positively, stating Rodr\u00edguez is cooperating and that the U.S. is dealing with the new leadership in Caracas. Trump warned that failure to align with U.S. objectives could lead to severe consequences but highlighted ongoing communications, including talks between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Venezuelan officials.\n\nThe shift allows the Trump administration to prioritize stabilizing Venezuela's oil infrastructure and security without immediate ground troop deployment. U.S. officials view Rodr\u00edguez as a potential partner for transition, given her background as a technocrat, despite past sanctions and ties to Maduro.\n\nOpposition leaders Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez continue pushing for Gonz\u00e1lez to assume power as the 2024 election winner. Machado urged the military to recognize Gonz\u00e1lez, but Trump has dismissed rapid opposition takeover, focusing instead on practical control through existing structures.\n\nInternational reactions remain mixed, with some Latin American nations condemning the U.S. intervention while others hope for democratic progress. The U.S. maintains a strong military presence in the region to ensure compliance.\n\nRodr\u00edguez's commission seeks Maduro's release, but her cooperative tone opens doors for U.S. access to Venezuela's vast oil reserves. Markets anticipate potential boosts for American energy firms as reconstruction begins.\n\nThis development reduces risks of immediate escalation, allowing time for negotiations on elections and reforms. Trump reiterated the U.S. goal of making Venezuela great again through American involvement.",

You may follow him at Twitter @FidelRahmati\n\nVenezuela's interim president Delcy Rodr\u00edguez announced her government is prepared to cooperate with the United States on joint development, signaling a significant diplomatic shift.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez, Venezuela's interim president, has said her government is ready to cooperate with the United States under a framework of \"joint development,\" adopting a conciliatory tone for the first time since the detention of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nReuters reported on Monday, January 5, that Rodr\u00edguez said in a statement her government seeks to establish respectful relations with Washington and has invited the United States to engage in cooperation based on international law.\n\nHer remarks mark a notable shift from earlier statements, when Rodr\u00edguez described the arrest of Maduro and his wife as an \"abduction\" and insisted that Maduro remained Venezuela's legitimate leader.\n\nThe change in rhetoric comes amid heightened tensions between Caracas and Washington, following months of political pressure, sanctions, and diplomatic standoffs over Venezuela's governance and energy sector.\n\nAnalysts say the overture may reflect Venezuela's growing economic strain and its desire to ease international isolation, particularly as oil revenues remain critical to stabilizing the country's battered economy.\n\nRelations between the United States and Venezuela have been severed for years, with Washington recognizing opposition figures instead of the Caracas leadership and imposing sweeping sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry.\n\nThe United States has repeatedly linked any normalization of ties to democratic reforms, cooperation on counter-narcotics efforts, and guarantees for foreign investment, especially in the energy sector.\n\nThe U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that if Venezuela fails to cooperate with U.S. efforts to reopen the oil industry and curb drug trafficking, he could authorize a second military strike.\n\nTrump has also threatened potential military action against Colombia and Mexico and claimed that Cuba's government \"appears ready to collapse,\" though embassies of the countries mentioned have so far declined to comment.",

      "title": "Maduro's Dancing Was the Last Straw  --  Why Trump Acted and Chose Delcy Rodr\u00edguez",
      "body": "In the final weeks of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's rule, it was not diplomacy, sanctions, or even covert threats that tipped the balance -- it was symbolism. According to multiple U.S. and Venezuelan officials involved in back-channel negotiations, Maduro's repeated public displays of defiance, particularly his on-air dancing amid escalating U.S. pressure, were interpreted inside the Trump White House as open mockery. For President Donald Trump, that perceived taunt became the final straw.\n\nBy late December, Washington had presented Maduro with what officials described as a \"gilded exile\" offer: step down peacefully and relocate to Turkey. Maduro refused. Days later, as the U.S. intensified pressure with a strike on a Venezuelan dock allegedly linked to drug trafficking, Maduro appeared on state television dancing to electronic music, his prerecorded voice repeating in English, \"No crazy war.\"\n\nInside the White House, the message was received loud and clear. According to sources familiar with the deliberations, Trump and his advisers concluded that Maduro believed Washington was bluffing. Within days, the United States followed through.\n\nA Decisive Military Move\n\nIn a pre-dawn operation, elite U.S. forces entered Caracas, encountered minimal resistance, destroyed multiple military installations, and extracted Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from a heavily guarded compound. They were flown to New York to face long-standing drug trafficking charges. At least 40 Venezuelans -- civilians and soldiers -- were reported killed during the operation, though no American casualties were announced.\n\nThe raid marked one of the most extraordinary unilateral uses of American military power in Latin America in decades. But the operation had not been improvised. Well before Maduro's capture, Washington had already settled on who it considered an \"acceptable\" interim leader for Venezuela.\n\nWhy Delcy Rodr\u00edguez Became Washington's Choice?\n\nThat choice was Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez -- a loyalist of the Maduro system, but one who had earned quiet respect inside U.S. policy circles.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56, is widely credited with stabilizing Venezuela's shattered economy and gradually increasing oil production despite U.S. sanctions. Her ability to navigate energy markets, manage elite interests, and maintain state control while opening limited space for private capital impressed several Trump officials, particularly those focused on oil security.\n\nIntermediaries convinced the administration that Rodr\u00edguez would safeguard future American energy investments and potentially cooperate on restoring U.S. access to Venezuelan oil. One senior U.S. official described her as \"someone we think we can work with at a professional level,\" in stark contrast to Maduro.\n\nFor Washington, this was not about democratic purity -- it was about leverage, predictability, and control over strategic resources.\n\nThe Rejection of Mar\u00eda Corina Machado\n\nPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Trump's decision was whom he rejected: Mar\u00eda Corina Machado.\n\nMachado, a longtime opposition leader, organized the opposition's winning presidential campaign in 2024 -- a victory widely recognized internationally as having been stolen by Maduro. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this year and spent months courting Trump's favor, praising him publicly, echoing his rhetoric on election fraud, and even dedicating her Peace Prize to him.\n\nNone of it mattered.\n\nTrump never warmed to Machado. On the day Maduro was captured, he publicly dismissed her, saying she lacked the \"respect\" and domestic support necessary to govern. Within hours of Machado declaring she was ready to assume power, Trump stated that they had not even spoken.\n\nFor the Trump administration, Machado represented unpredictability -- an independent political force with moral legitimacy but limited control over the armed forces and state institutions. Rodr\u00edguez, by contrast, came from within the system and was seen as capable of holding it together.\n\nWashington's High-Risk Bet\n\nTrump's declaration that the United States would effectively \"run\" Venezuela for an unspecified period and reclaim American oil interests stunned even seasoned observers. It signaled a shift from regime-change rhetoric to direct, expansionist control -- justified less by democracy than by drugs, energy, and national security.\n\nYet contradictions remain. Rodr\u00edguez publicly condemned the U.S. operation, called it an illegal invasion, and insisted Maduro remains Venezuela's legitimate leader. Venezuelan state media continues to refer to her as vice president, not president -- a calculated move to pacify military and party loyalists still reeling from the humiliation of Maduro's capture.\n\nSanctions remain in place, oil tankers are still being detained, and Washington has made clear that further military action remains on the table if Rodr\u00edguez defies U.S. expectations.\n\nA Technocrat Born of the System\n\nRodr\u00edguez is no outsider. She is the daughter of a Marxist guerrilla, educated in France, and politically shaped by the Ch\u00e1vez-Maduro era. While she softened Venezuela's economic collapse and built bridges with business elites and foreign diplomats, she has never condemned the repression or corruption that sustained the regime.\n\nHer rise reflects a familiar historical pattern: insiders of authoritarian systems stepping forward as transitional figures when the strongman falls.\n\nWhether Delcy Rodr\u00edguez becomes a stabilizing bridge or merely a more polished face of the same power structure will depend less on her rhetoric -- and more on how long Washington believes she serves its interests.\n\nFor now, Trump has made his calculation clear: democracy is secondary; control is primary. And Maduro's final dance may have sealed his fate.",

      "title": "Trump Warns Venezuela's Leader Delcy Rodr\u00edguez Of Severe Consequences Ahead Of Swearing In",
      "body": "Donald Trump warns Rodr\u00edguez she could \"pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro\" before taking office.\n\nDonald Trump has issued a stern warning to Venezuela's new leader, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, saying she could \"pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro\" if she \"doesn't do what's right.\" Rodr\u00edguez is set to be sworn in today, amid heightened tensions following US military action against former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nThe swearing in ceremony at Venezuela's National Assembly comes after the Supreme Court designated Rodr\u00edguez as interim president over the weekend, following a US operation that seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The US has said Maduro will face drugs and weapons charges in New York.\n\nSpeaking to The Atlantic, Trump added, \"Regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now.\" He has vowed that the US will run the country until \"a safe and proper and judicious transition\" is possible, promising that American oil companies will move in to fix infrastructure \"and start making money for the country.\"\n\nIn response, Rodr\u00edguez appealed directly to the US president during her first cabinet meeting: \"Our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war.\" She further stated, \"Venezuela has the right to peace, development, sovereignty and a future,\" inviting the US to \"collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation\" within the framework of international law.\n\nMaduro faces multiple charges including \"Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States,\" according to US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Trump described these as part of Maduro's \"campaign of deadly narco-terrorism\" against the US and its citizens. Maduro has denied being a cartel leader, calling the charges a pretext to remove him from power.\n\nJulia Buxton, professor of justice studies at Liverpool John Moores University, criticized the US framing, saying it rests on \"very flimsy ground.\" She told BBC Breakfast that Venezuela is \"not a major exporter of cocaine\" and explained, \"The bulk of cocaine going into the US comes through the Pacific Coast, up through Mexico and Colombia. There's no fentanyl coming out of Venezuela. What the Trump administration has had to do is kind of invent this notion of Maduro as a narco-terrorist in order to carry out policies of regime change.\"\n\nCuba has confirmed 32 of its citizens were killed during the US operation to seize Maduro. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said the nation honored \"the brave Cuban combatants who fell taking on the terrorists in imperial uniforms who kidnapped and illegally removed the Venezuelan president and his wife from their country.\" Trump, meanwhile, said military action against Cuba is unlikely but did not rule out intervention in Colombia.\n\nThe dramatic events were executed with extensive US surveillance. Spies monitored Maduro's daily routines for months before the operation. According to Trump, \"He made it to the door. He was unable to close it,\" adding, \"He got bum rushed so fast that he didn't get into that (room).\"By 04:20 local time, helicopters left Venezuelan territory with Maduro and Flores on board, en route to New York to face charges.\n\nFreddy Guevara, a former political prisoner, told BBC Radio 4 that Venezuela has been left with \"the leftovers of the Maduro regime.\" He added that Maduro's rule had been maintained \"by force and fear\" and relied heavily on international support.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez, a lawyer and diplomat who has long served in Maduro's inner circle, has called for cooperation with the US despite the turbulent circumstances. Previously, she had refused to acknowledge Venezuela becoming \"a colony of an empire,\" but at her first cabinet meeting, she struck a more conciliatory tone, emphasizing collaboration.\n\nTrump's actions and warnings have sparked global reactions. Chinese officials condemned the US operation, saying \"hegemonic acts of the US seriously violate international law and Venezuela's sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region.\" Former MI6 chief Sir Alex Younger commented that the world is now governed by \"strong men presiding over spheres of influences,\" with Trump embodying this approach.",

      "title": "Delcy Rodriguez: Who is Venezuela's new leader?",
      "body": "Delcy Rodriguez will be sworn in as president of Venezuela on Monday following Nicolas Maduro's sudden capture by the United States.\n\nThe vice president, who is also finance minister and minister for oil, will step into a precarious position after Donald Trump claimed that the US would \"run\" the country - without elaborating on what this would mean.\n\nShe faced threats from the US president before even taking office, who warned that she would \"pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro\" if she \"doesn't do what's right\".\n\nRodriguez, 56, initially branded the operation to oust Maduro a violation of international law and called on foreign governments to condemn the action, saying: \"History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay. There is only one president in Venezuela and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\"\n\nBut within hours she had dropped her fiery rhetoric, telling her first cabinet meeting on Sunday that she was \"inviting\" the United States to \"work together on an agenda for cooperation\".\n\nIn a reversal of her longstanding support for Maduro, Rodriguez on Sunday offered to work with with the US on an agenda focused on \"shared development\".\n\nA law graduate from Caracas, she rapidly rose through the political ranks under Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, and became a key figure in his regime.\n\nAfter Chavez died in 2013, Rodriguez remained loyal to the government of Maduro, serving as communications minister in 2013-14 and foreign minister, 2014-17. During this period she was sanctioned by the United States, while defending the regime against foreign accusations of human rights abuses.\n\nMaduro called Rodriguez a \"tiger\" for her diehard defence of his socialist government and rewarded her with the role of vice president in 2018 for his second term.\n\nAfter the controversial 2024 elections, she stayed in post for his third term, beginning in 2025.\n\nHer other roles, managing oil and the country's finances, have made her a key figure in the management of Venezuela's economy and gained her major influence with the country's withered private sector.\n\nAs oil minister, she was also tasked with managing escalating US sanctions on the country's most important industry.\n\nTrump now appears to have given Rodriguez his blessing to run Venezuela, so long as she is willing to facilitate his vision for the country.\n\nWhile suggesting the US would \"run\" Venezuela until \"we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\", Trump also revealed his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had been talking with Rodriguez, who he assessed was \"willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again\".\n\nOne senior US official told the New York Times on condition of anonymity: \"I'm not claiming that she's the permanent solution to the country's problems, but she's certainly someone we think we can work at a much more professional level than we were able to do with [Maduro].\"\n\nThe outlet reported that Rodriguez was singled out as the best candidate to replace Maduro weeks ago, after impressing officials with her handling of the oil industry.\n\nSources involved in discussions said the Trump administration was persuaded she would protect future American energy investments in the country.\n\nRodriguez became interim president after being sworn in by the nation's Supreme Court on Monday. Under Venezuela's constitution, the vice president takes over when the president is absent.\n\nUS officials have said the US is \"not at war with Venezuela\" and that it is not planning any further military action, though Trump said \"we're not afraid of boots on the ground\".\n\nThere is also the question of natural resources. Venezuela is rich in oil and rare earth minerals, which serve as extremely valuable commodities. The South American country has $1.36 trillion worth of mineral wealth, according to Maduro.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said: \"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Rubio denied that the US wanted Venezuela's oil.\n\n\"We have plenty of oil in the United States,\" he said. \"What we're not going to allow is for the oil industry in Venezuela to be controlled by adversaries of the United States.\"\n\nMaduro has arrived in New York and was shown arriving at a detention facility where he will await his first court appearance on US criminal charges.\n\nIn a video shared on Saturday night by the White House, Maduro wished an onlooker \"Happy New Year\" as he walked down a hallway in handcuffs and a black hoodie. He will appear in court in New York at 5pm local time.\n\nHe and his wife have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the US.\n\n\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" US attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump has accused Maduro of being a top-level member of a drug cartel, \"Cartel de los Soles\", which he claims is trafficking drugs into the US.\n\nMaduro has denied the allegations and Trump has not shared evidence of Maduro's involvement, but has used these allegations to justify his lethal military operations against Venezuelan ships.",

      "body": "The political takeover of Venezuela does not appear to be going according to plan, if there ever was a plan. A day after the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, President Donald Trump used the phrase \"run the country.\" A day later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio watered it down to \"running policy\" and made the next phase sound more like a series of strong suggestions. Trump also publicly suggested that Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez might cooperate with the U.S. But then Rodr\u00edguez gave a televised address saying Venezuela \"will never return to being the colony of another empire.\" Trump followed that up with a threat, delivered through an interview with The Atlantic: \"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"\n\nUnlike the precise military operation that whisked Maduro out of Venezuela, the political follow-up seems like improvisation and chaos, but maybe chaos is the point. In this episode of Radio Atlantic we talk with staff writers Michael Sherer, who talked with President Trump on Sunday, and Vivian Salama, who writes about the administration and Venezuela. They talk about Trump's evolving vision of his role in the world and how it might be unsettling other world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Salama notes that world leaders now may \"think twice about crossing the U.S. when President Trump is so unpredictable and uses the U.S. military in very unconventional ways, and shuns the guardrails that keep a U.S. president in check.\"",

      "title": "Trump Wants Control, Not Change, in Venezuela | Novara Media",
      "body": "Later today, Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores will face federal drugs and weapons charges in a New York courtroom. That's a sentence no-one imagined they'd be writing just two days ago. But in the early hours of Saturday, US special forces bombed the country's north, entered the capital Caracas, and besieged the safe house where Maduro was staying before abducting the couple back to the world's most powerful rogue state.\n\nThe operation took just two hours and 20 minutes; more than enough time, it turns out, to confetti the ragged remains of the rules-based international order. But initial diagnosis of regime change increasingly appears misplaced. Instead, key personnel within the Maduro government, minus its head, appear to be falling neatly into Trumpian line - for now.\n\nPanto season is, of course, long over. But could it be that puppetry is about to make a comeback?\n\nThe most striking feature of the US military's Venezuela operation wasn't the 150 bombers, fighter jets and surveillance planes deployed to capture Maduro and his wife; nor the rapid targeting of the country's air defence systems that quickly knocked them out; and nor the terrifying slickness with which the US's top special operations Delta force extracted the presidential couple from their location.\n\nIt was how little prepared for - and perhaps how unresistant to - US intervention the Venezuelan military and political elite appears to have been.\n\nThat's especially notable given how clear US president Donald Trump's administration has been about its intentions to depose Maduro. From August last year, the US military built up a substantial presence in the Caribbean, allegedly to combat drug-trafficking. That soon turned into targeted murder, with at least 36 airstrikes on alleged drug vessels following - killing 115 people.\n\nThe US military also blockaded Venezuelan waters, using special forces to seize an oil tanker in early December, then another weeks later. Just days before Operation Absolute Resolve would see Maduro abducted and at least 80 people killed (32 of them Cuban military or ministerial personnel) in the process, it was revealed that the CIA had carried out a drone strike inside Venezuela, targeting a port on its coast.\n\nEveryone could see the writing was on the wall - not least of all Maduro, who in November called on the country's air forces to prepare to defend Venezuela. Perhaps that call was heeded; but perhaps those around the former president also intuited a different message, one made explicit by Trump in a post-operation press conference on Saturday: \"All of the Venezuelan military and politicians should understand that what happened to Maduro can happen to them\".\n\nWhile many of the eight million Venezuelans who've lived in exile globally since Maduro's rise to power celebrated the possibility of a return to democracy on Saturday, by Sunday the Trump administration had made its more limited aims pretty clear.\n\nThe US would, Trump said on Saturday night and reaffirmed this morning, \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper and judicious transition\" could be guaranteed. In the meantime, he told reporters, (corporate) America First is the name of the game.\n\n\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in,\" he said, \"spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"\n\nNo need to wonder which country he meant.\n\nTrump's vice-president JD Vance went even further, describing Venezuela's oil - the largest reserve of crude in the world - as \"stolen\" and demanding it be \"returned to the United States\".\n\nThat aim appears to involve working with rather than against the longstanding Venezuelan political elite. The country now has a new acting president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, backed both by Trump and Venezuela's constitution, and sworn in by the country's supreme court in the hours following the US attack on the country.\n\nBut Rodr\u00edguez, Maduro's vice-president as well as the country's oil minister, appeared initially defiant on Saturday night, correctly labelling the illegal operation by US forces an \"atrocity\" and stating: \"There is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\".\n\nResponding to those comments on Sunday, Trump told The Atlantic: \"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\" His secretary of state Marco Rubio took a more measured line, saying: \"There's a lot of different reasons why people go on TV and say certain things in these countries, especially 15 hours or 12 hours after the person who used to be in charge of the regime is now in handcuffs.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Rodr\u00edguez was long ago picked as a pliant replacement for Maduro, one whose management of Venezuela's oil industry impressed those close to Trump. Meanwhile, the Sunday Times reported sources close to Rodr\u00edguez claiming that the US had offered her several deals to replace Maduro ahead of the attack. They say she refused them.\n\nAdding to the sense that it's regime control, rather than regime change, that Washington is after was Trump's rebuff of suggestions that Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of Venezuela's opposition, might lead the country. \"She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country,\" Trump said. \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect.\"\n\nPeace prize aside, the Nobel Laureate seemed quite happy to urge on potentially violent regime change on Saturday, immediately calling for Venezuela's military to ditch Maduro (on Sunday, the army gave its support to Rodr\u00edguez). She does seem to have been left out of the loop, though. \"Minutes after the attack on Caracas began,\" the Sunday Times reported, \"a representative for Machado sent a text to a Sunday Times journalist asking them whether they had any information on what was happening\".\n\nIf puppetry is, as it seems, the US's new pastime, then sidelining Machado makes sense. If it's control you want, it's easier won from a fragile remnant of the old regime whose survival depends on your patronage than from a newcomer with big ideas, international support and a democratic mandate.\n\nOf course, regime control is just as risky - and potentially just as deadly - as regime change. What begins as fracas may quickly become massacre. While Rodr\u00edguez has now called on the US to \"collaborate\" with Venezuela towards \"shared development within the framework of international law\", that's unlikely to be a sentiment shared by all parts of the country's establishment. And the framing of Maduro's rule as a simple dictatorship by many in the media has no doubt obscured the more complex, and potentially dangerous, domestic political cross-currents in Venezuela that could now be unleashed.\n\nIt goes without saying that the US's Venezuelan adventure runs counter to international law. It's also hardly worth saying, given the west has spent the last two years quiet-quitting the charade of international legal or humanitarian obligations.\n\nThe lack of condemnation from British and European leaders to the photos of a sitting head of state blindfolded, handcuffed and in the captivity of a US president who unilaterally bypassed the last remaining checks-and-balances on his power to pursue imperialist control tells you all you need to know about who butters their bread. Many will also now be calculating the benefits of Trump's militarism to their own strategic and economic aims, not least of all when it comes to Russia.\n\nAnd speaking of: for other strong-man powers, Trump's endorsement of might-is-right is a golden ticket for those looking to extend regional control of their own. But you only have to look to Washington to see how emboldening Saturday's operation has been.\n\nCuba, threatened Rubio on Sunday, could be next. \"Sounds good to me,\" is how Trump described a future military operation in Colombia last night. \"We do need Greenland,\" the president told the Atlantic on Sunday. \"Absolutely. We need it for defence.\"\n\nWe can't yet know much about what 2026 has in store for us. But just five days in, we can say one thing with certainty: this year is not messing.",

The NYT reported that Rodriguez, whom Trump threatened by saying \"You will pay a heavier price,\" was identified weeks ago as the person to replace Maduro. It was noted that the belief that Rodriguez could protect American energy investments in the future influenced this decision.\n\nIt was claimed that the Donald Trump administration in the United States shaped its Venezuela plan in line with U.S. interests and saw Vice President Delcy Rodriguez as a more \"reasonable\" option for interim leadership following the detention of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nAccording to a report by The New York Times (NYT) based on U.S. and Venezuelan sources familiar with the matter, Maduro's \"relaxed\" demeanor reflected in the public in recent weeks was interpreted by some members of Trump's team as \"not taking the U.S. seriously\" and \"bluffing.\" Sources argued that Maduro's attitude influenced the White House's decision to implement military threats against Venezuela.\n\nSources indicated that U.S. officials weeks ago reached a consensus on a \"reasonable\" name to replace Maduro, settling on Vice President Rodriguez, noting that the belief that Rodriguez could protect American energy investments in the future influenced this decision.\n\nA senior U.S. official speaking to the newspaper stated that they did not claim Rodriguez was a \"permanent solution,\" but they believed a professional relationship could be established with her that was not possible with Maduro.\n\nThe Trump administration's sidelining of Nobel Prize-winning opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in favor of Rodriguez is interpreted as a sign of a \"self-interested\" approach. It is stated that the relationship to be established with Rodriguez will depend on adherence to U.S. interests, and otherwise, new military steps may be on the agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, who were kidnapped by the U.S., will appear in court today at 20:00 Turkish time. The Washington administration accuses Maduro of \"drug-related terrorism\" and various organized crime charges. The indictment announced by the U.S. prosecution includes charges such as conspiracy to traffic drugs, possession of heavy weapons, and \"destructive activities.\"\n\nOn January 3, around 02:00 local time in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, explosions and sounds of aircraft were heard. The Venezuelan government accused the U.S. of carrying out attacks on civilian and military facilities in various regions of the country following the explosions.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced that a large-scale attack was carried out against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and that Maduro and his wife were taken out of the country.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also stated that a criminal complaint had been filed against Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in the U.S., with charges against Maduro including \"drug terrorism, cocaine trafficking, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices against the U.S.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan government has called on the international community to condemn the U.S., with some countries criticizing the attack while others have supported the U.S. with their statements.\n\nThe Venezuelan Supreme Court (TSJ) decided that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez would assume the role of interim President of the country following Maduro's detention. Trump stated in a statement, \"I will take you too; you will pay a heavier price. You can pay a heavier price than Maduro.\"",

Jim WATSON / AFP\n\nPresident Donald Trump threatened Sunday that Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodriguez will pay a \"very big price\" if she doesn't cooperate with the United States, after US forces seized and jailed her former boss Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,\" Trump told The Atlantic in a brief telephone interview.\n\nUS forces attacked Caracas in the early hours of Saturday, bombing military targets and spiriting away Maduro and his wife to face federal narcotrafficking charges in New York.\n\nThe Trump administration says it is willing to work with the rest of Maduro's government as long as Washington's goals, including opening access to US investment in the enormous Venezuelan crude oil reserves, are met.\n\nTrump's warning came as Rodriguez was confirmed as interim president by Venezuela's Supreme Court and military officials.\n\nShe sounded a defiant note Saturday after the US raid on the capital Caracas, saying that Maduro was the country's sole legitimate leader and that \"we're ready to defend our natural resources.\"\n\nTrump has long campaigned against US nation building and regime change in foreign countries.\n\nHowever, he said Saturday that the United States will \"run\" Venezuela.\n\nHe told The Atlantic that \"rebuilding there and regime change -- anything you want to call it -- is better than what you have right now.\"\n\n\"Rebuilding is not a bad thing in Venezuela's case,\" he said. \"The country's gone to hell. It's a failed country. It's a totally failed country. It's a country that's a disaster in every way.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old Republican also repeated his frequent demand that Greenland -- an autonomous territory belonging to the NATO ally Denmark -- become part of the United States.\n\nAsked what the US military action in Venezuela signalled for Greenland, Trump told The Atlantic: \"They are going to have to view it themselves. I really don't know.\"\n\n\"But we do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense.\"",

This decree of \"external commotion\" is expected to obtain judicial approval in the coming hours for its immediate execution.\n\nThe vice president highlighted the international support, mentioning that the community has \"added and raised their voices\" from China, Russia, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia.

      "body": "After Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture by the United States, Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was appointed interim president of Venezuela.\n\nIn a move that stunned both Washington and Caracas, Donald Trump's dramatic capture of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has blown a hole right through Venezuela's power structure. But instead of weakening socialism, it may have handed the spotlight to a new set of players, exactly the kind of \"anti-American socialists\" Trump has spent years condemning.\n\nWith Maduro now in US custody, attention has shifted to Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and her brother Jorge. Together, they represent the smoother, more polished face of Venezuela's Marxist project.\n\nRodr\u00edguez's politics didn't begin in an office. They were inherited. Her father, Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, was a Marxist guerrilla leader in the 1970s, infamous for his role in the kidnapping of American businessman William Niehous. His death in police custody later became a rallying symbol for the Chavista movement, which is a concoction of socialism, nationalism, and anti-US rhetoric.\n\nThat history matters. Trump may pride himself on taking on radical leftists, but he's now dealing with someone whose entire family story is rooted in anti-imperialist struggle.\n\nDelcy's power is amplified by her older brother Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, Maduro's chief political operator and the man many see as the brains behind the regime.\n\nAs head of the National Assembly, Jorge has quietly shaped strategy and messaging, helping the government survive years of economic chaos and political pressure.\n\nTogether, the siblings pulled off what once seemed impossible: they tamed runaway inflation and nudged oil production back toward one million barrels a day, even while US sanctions tightened the screws.\n\n\"Maduro was the face of the crisis, not the brains behind the system,\" a government official familiar with backchannel diplomacy told Firstpost.\n\n\"By removing him, the US hasn't broken Chavismo, it's made room for a younger, more disciplined leadership that knows how to stabilise the economy, talk to global markets, and push back against Washington without the theatrics,\" the official added.\n\nTrump, of course, hasn't softened his tone. He recently warned that if Delcy doesn't cooperate, \"she's going to pay a very big price -- probably bigger than Maduro.\"\n\nBut behind the scenes, the story looks different. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reportedly been in touch with her and later described her as \"gracious.\"\n\nThat's the irony in all this. Trump may have taken down a strongman, only to clear the way for a sharper, English-speaking, more politically savvy socialist leadership.",

Trump rattled the world by attacking Caracas and grabbing Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are now being detained in New York.\n\n\"The Trump administration is quite pragmatic. President Trump is doing the right thing,\" Galicia told NDTV while talking about the US leader's approach in Venezuela.\n\nThe 29-year-old was a student political activist involved in liberty-minded campus groups in Venezuela. Maduro's crackdown on dissenting voices made him go into hiding and flee to the US in 2018.\n\n\"I am glad to know Maduro was rooted out. I am really excited to see such a change,\" Galicia said.\n\nMaduro, 63, faces charges that accuse him of providing support to major drug trafficking groups, such as the Sinaloa Cartel and the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nThe Venezuelan activist recalled how he faced political persecution in Venezuela under Maduro's regime. \"The agents of the Maduro government took my friend away. I had to go into hiding before leaving the country,\" he said.\n\nHe, however, warned that not much will change in Venezuela under the acting president, Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nDespite Maduro's ouster, his government remains in power in Caracas, and top officials have remained defiant.\n\nVice President Delcy Rodriguez, who has taken over as interim leader, has said Maduro remains president and has contradicted Trump's claim that she is willing to work with the United States. Rodriguez, who also serves as oil minister, has long been considered the most pragmatic member of Maduro's inner circle.\n\n\"Delcy Rodriguez should be imprisoned. I am not sure if it is safe for exiled leaders to return, as agents of the Maduro government are patrolling the streets. The interim government doesn't want people to mobilise,\" Galicia said.\n\nThe United States has deemed Maduro an illegitimate dictator since he declared victory in a 2018 election marred by allegations of massive irregularities. But Trump has dismissed the idea of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado taking over, saying she lacks support.'\n\nWhen asked if Machado can play a significant role in the formation of the new government in Venezuela, Galicia noted that the Nobel laureate doesn't enjoy support in the current power structure of the South American nation.\n\n\"Machado has been sidelined a bit. Not the right time for her to return,\" he said.\n\nMachado was banned from the 2024 election but has said her ally Edmundo Gonzalez has a mandate to take the presidency, and some international observers say he overwhelmingly won that vote.\n\nShow full article\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nVenezuela News, Nicolas Maduro, Jorge Galicia",

      "title": "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez calls for cooperation with US while Trump demands 'total access' in Venezuela",
      "body": "In her first statement as the new \"acting president of Venezuela,\" Delcy Rodr\u00edguez sent a conciliatory message to the United States that contrasted with the usual belligerent tone used by Chavismo against Washington. Meanwhile, Donald Trump kept up the threats, demanding \"total access\" to the country's \"oil and to other things\" while maintaining that \"we're in charge.\"\n\nLess than 48 hours after the attack that decapitated the Venezuelan regime with the capture of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Rodr\u00edguez, far from being confrontational, has extended an olive branch to the enemy. \"We extend an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperative agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\" reads a post on her Instagram account.\n\nIt was a surprisingly conciliatory message \"to the world\" and \"to the United States.\" Despite nearly a hundred possible casualties of the U.S. attack in Caracas early Saturday morning, including 32 Cubans who were part of her inner security detail, the former vice president asserted that it is a \"priority\" to move toward a \"balanced and respectful\" relationship with the U.S. and the countries of the region, \"based on sovereign equality and non-interference.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez's tone was a far cry from the usual terms Chavismo uses to describe Washington. There was no mention of imperialism, violations of international law, or the theft of natural resources -- accusations that have been recurring during these four months of escalating tensions between the two countries. There was only a tepid condemnation of U.S. intervention in Venezuela: \"Our country aspires to live without external threats.\"\n\nIn a direct appeal to President Donald Trump, Rodr\u00edguez wrote: \"Our people and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war. That has always been President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's position, and it is the position of all Venezuelans right now. That is the Venezuela I believe in, the one to which I have dedicated my life. My dream is for Venezuela to be a great power where all good Venezuelans can come together.\"\n\nThe new leader of the South American country made these remarks even as Washington increasingly sharpens its demands that Venezuelan authorities comply with its orders. \"We're in charge,\" the U.S. president emphasized on Sunday night.\n\n\"We need total access. We need access to the oil and to other things in their country that allow us to rebuild their country, to roads and bridges to rebuild them,\" Trump said in remarks from Air Force One, returning to Washington after two weeks at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. And if the new authorities are not cooperative there will be a second attack, said the president, who in an interview with The Atlantic had already warned the new Venezuelan leader that if she \"doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"\n\nAccording to Trump, in the conversations his team has held with the Venezuelan leader, there has still been no talk about the release of political prisoners, one of the demands made by the opposition movement led by Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez.",

      "title": "What are Trump's post-Maduro plans for Venezuela? | The Spectator Australia",
      "body": "Donald Trump likes to keep both his friends and enemies guessing. It's no surprise then that his plans for Venezuela's future after his typically bold and reckless abduction of dictator Nicolas Maduro are a mystery.\n\nTrump has awarded the plum of power in Caracas not to Machado but to Maduro's vice-president and oil minister Delcy Rodriguez\n\nIn his Mar-a-Largo news conference after the bombing and special forces raid on Caracas that caught the mustachioed Marxist napping, and delivered him to US custody, the US president begged as many questions as he answered. Looking and sounding understandably exhausted after watching the nighttime Operation Absolute Resolve unfold on a live feed in real time, and appearing every one of his 79 years, Trump made a series of confusing and contradictory statements about US policy for a post-Maduro future in Venezuela. It left America's allies struggling to make sense of his intentions, and worried about where the erratic president will strike next.\n\nTrump announced that the United States will 'run' the country without explaining how that will be possible without US boots on Venezuelan soil in an Iraq-style occupation. And he vowed to put American oil companies in to Venezuela to control its potentially enormous oil industry and take back assets allegedly 'stolen' from the US, without making clear how that squares with restoring Venezuela as an independent state.\n\nMost opaque of all, instead of pledging to return power to the conservative opposition which won elections in 2024 by a landslide - only to see Maduro rig the result in his favour - the president appears ready to work with the ousted leader's corrupt and criminal communist regime, which he has accused of being a narco-terrorist front in league with Iran and China. Trump even went out of his way to diss Venezuela's courageous exiled opposition leader Maria Corina Machado who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize, (which Trump thought should rightfully have been his for negotiating the Gaza ceasefire). Although patronising Machado as a 'nice woman', he claimed, without any evidence, that she had little support within Venezuela.\n\nTrump has awarded the plum of power in Caracas not to Machado but to Maduro's vice-president and oil minister Delcy Rodriguez, who has now been sworn in as interim president while her former boss faces drug smuggling and terrorism charges today in a Manhattan courtroom. Trump seems ready to recognise Rodriguez as Venezuela's legitimate leader, despite the regime that she now leads having reduced the country to an economic and social disaster zone which has forced eight million people - a staggering one in three Venezuelans - to flee abroad, many of them to the US.\n\nDespite Rodriguez denouncing the US raid in a fiery broadcast, she appears to have convinced Trump she is someone he can do business with - in spite of her deep involvement in the Maduro regime.\n\nYet the Trump administration itself seems less than united about what to do next. The president says America will return to Venezuela with more force should that be necessary, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Cuban American hawk on Latin America, has made a veiled threat against the long established communist ruled island that his parents fled. Meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's national intelligence director, who spoke out against US intervention before the raid, has been conspicuously silent since it took place.\n\nAmerica's Nato allies fear that Trump's unilateral action in breaching international law has robbed the West of its moral advantage over Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, and may embolden China to attack Taiwan. They also fret that Trump will be encouraged to carry out his threat to seize Greenland, which the president has deemed essential for the defence of America.\n\nAlthough Maduro is gone, and the streets of Caracas are currently quiet, the repressive military-backed regime that he led is still in place. Trump looks less like a principled conservative acting firmly against a Marxist dictatorship, and more like an opportunistic businessman with little regard of the risk to world order.",

      "body": "With deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a US jail, President Donald Trump warned the South American country's authoritarian rulers they will \"pay a very big price\" if they don't \"cooperate\" with Washington, even amid global concerns over the US military strike.\n\nTrump, in an interview publishedon January 4 in the Atlantic, warned acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez that \"if she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"\n\nThe leftist Rodriguez, who was Maduro's vice president before being named acting president on January 4, called the US action a violation of the UN Charter and vowed that \"we will never be slaves again.\"\n\nMaduro on January 4 was sitting in a US jail after being transported to New York following his capture by American forces in the strike that was condemned by Iran, Russia, and other allies of the South American country but hailed by Venezuelans living in exile.\n\nA video posted by Fox News on social media showed Maduro, 63, being escorted by federal agents and telling reporters, \"Good night, Happy New Year.\"\n\nHe and his wife -- who was also captured in the raid -- are scheduled to appear in court on January 5 to face drug charges.\n\nIn a news conference, Trump hailed the military operation in Venezuela but did not provide details of the action. A top US general said 150 US aircraft were involved in the strike following months of preparations.\n\nCasualty figures were not revealed. Trump said some US personnel were injured but doing well. Meanwhile, Cuba said that 32 members of its security forces were killed in Venezuela during the US attack.\n\nTrump caused a stir when he said the United States will temporarily \"run\" the South American country \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper, \u2060and \u2060judicious transition.\"\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what Trump meant by having the United States \"run\" the country. He told reporters he was \"designating people\" from his cabinet to be in charge in Venezuela, without providing details.\n\nUS administration officials -- including Secretary of State Marco Rubio -- did not offer clarifications when pressed during January 4 TV news programs about Trump's plan.\n\nVenezuela's Supreme Court ordered that Rodriguez assume the role of acting president of the left-wing government.\n\nTrump initially expressed support for Rodriguez, saying \"she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"\n\nRodriguez -- backed by support of the Venezuelan military -- first appeared defiant, calling Maduro the \"only president\" of the country labeling the US strike a \"terrible stain\" on relations.\n\nAfter Trump signaled he was ready to conduct a second wave of military actions in Venezuela if necessary, Rodriguez was more conciliatory, writing on social media early on January 5 that Caracas sought a \"balanced and respectful\" relationship with Washington\n\n\"We extend an invitation to the US government to work together on an agenda for cooperation that is aimed toward shared development,\" she wrote.\n\nMoscow, which maintains close ties with Venezuela, said it was extremely concerned by reports that Maduro and his wife had been forcibly removed from the country and urged the United States to release them.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who has a history of exchanging threats with Trump, wrote on X that the US strikes on Venezuela had nothing to do with efforts to combat drug trafficking, adding that he doubted whether Washington could \"run Venezuela remotely.\"\n\nSome Kremlin critics consider Medvedev -- currently deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council -- an irresponsible extremist, while others say his statements reflect the thinking of many senior Russian policymakers.\n\nIran, another key ally of Venezuela, condemned the US attack, according to Iranian state outlet Press TV, saying the action violated Venezuela's sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the UN charter.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who recently called Maduro \"a great friend of Serbia,\" on January 3 said it was \"clear\" the international legal order and the UN Charter \"do not function.\"\n\n\"The world is dominated by the law of force, the law of the stronger, and that is the only principle of modern politics that exists in the world today,\" Vucic told a national security council meeting in Belgrade.\n\nMeanwhile, celebrations by Venezuelans living abroad marking Maduro's capture were held across Latin America cities, Spain, and elsewhere.\n\n\"We are free. We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country,\" Reuters quoted Khaty Yanez, a Venezuelan woman in Santiago who has spent seven years in Chile.\n\nIn Peru's capital, Lima, migrant Milagros Ortega, whose parents are still in Venezuela, said she hoped to go back. \"Knowing that my dad was alive to see the fall of Nicolas Maduro is very emotional. I would like to see his face.\"\n\nMany of Washington's allies, while expressing no liking for Maduro or his regime, did caution over the need to follow international law.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that \"we regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,\" adding, \"I reiterated my support for international law this morning.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Maduro had \"led his country to ruin,\" but he called the US action legally \"complex.\"\n\nHowever, far-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni -- an ally of Trump's -- called the US action \"legitimate\" and \"defensive.\"\n\nOthers, such as Ukraine, North Macedonia, Albania, and Kosovo, said following the strikes that they stand firmly with Washington and its most direct intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama.\n\n\"I welcome [Trump's] announcement that Nicolas Maduro has been arrested and will face justice. We stand with the United States and the Venezuelan people for freedom and democracy,\" North Macedonia Foreign Minister Timco Mucunski said on social media.\n\nEuropean Union countries, excluding Hungary, called on all sides in Venezuela to show restraint, saying respect for the will of the Venezuelan people was key to restoring democracy.\n\n\"The European Union calls for calm and restraint by all actors, to avoid escalation and to ensure a peaceful solution to the crisis,\" the joint statement by the 26 countries said.\n\nThe US military action came after months of rising economic and military pressure from Washington on the South American country, including intercepting Venezuelan oil tankers and killing dozens in strikes on boats near its waters that were allegedly carrying drugs.\n\nWashington also contested Maduro's legitimacy as president since he was the hand-picked successor to Hugo Chavez in 2013, pointing to successive elections the opposition and others said were rigged in his favor.\n\nSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/venezuela-maduro-trump- capture-reaction/33639570.html\n\nCopyright (c) 2026.

      "title": "A clearer picture is emerging of what Trump meant when he said the US will 'run' Venezuela",
      "body": "West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) -- President Donald Trump's administration is working quickly to establish a pliant interim government in Venezuela following the dramatic capture of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, according to US officials, prioritizing administrative stability and repairing the country's oil infrastructure over an immediate turn to democracy.\n\nOfficials described a multifold effort using American military and economic leverage to influence the remnants of Maduro's regime left inside Venezuela. In particular, US officials have focused squarely on the country's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who Trump advisers identified weeks ago as a viable, if nonpermanent, alternative to Maduro. Despite Rodr\u00edguez's initial attacks on the administration over Maduro's capture, US officials privately maintained optimism she would work with the United States.\n\nBy Sunday night, Rodr\u00edguez was striking a softer tone than she previously had, calling for \"cooperation\" with the US. Rodr\u00edguez said Venezuela will \"prioritize\" moving toward \"balanced and respectful international relations\" with the US and the region.\n\nSenior-level US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, top aide Stephen Miller and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have been working to develop a structure for Venezuela's government in the wake of Maduro's ouster, according to a senior US official. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright have been tasked with convincing American energy companies to return to Venezuela and its aging oil infrastructure.\n\nThe clearer picture that began emerging Sunday of what Trump meant when he claimed during an extraordinary news conference the United States would \"run\" Venezuela was essentially one in which the US relies on the massive armada floating offshore to ensure whoever is in charge does what the Trump administration wants.\n\nMany questions remained about how, precisely, the US plans to establish what amounts to a temporary protectorate in a country of 31 million people that is roughly twice the size of California. There has been no official American presence in Venezuela since the US Embassy closed in Caracas in 2019.\n\nAnd the risks for Trump appeared significant, even as he brushed off concerns he was repeating the mistakes of American adventurism abroad and threatened more military action if Rodr\u00edguez did not submit to his demands. Even his most immediate goal -- gaining US access to Venezuela's vast oil reserves -- could potentially put US troops in harm's way if, as Trump suggested, they are deployed to protect those assets.\n\nSpeaking Sunday, Rubio -- a chief architect of Trump's Venezuela policy who the president said would be included in the group \"running\" the country -- offered a broad portrait of what that meant.\n\n\"What we are running is the direction that this is going to move moving forward,\" he said on ABC News. \"And that is, we have leverage. This leverage we are using.\"\n\nThat leverage, he said, includes the blockade of oil tankers intended to cut off Caracas' main economic lifeline and the continued American military presence around Venezuela. An administration source also said the oil sanctions would remain in place for now.\n\n\"When the president said the United States is going to be running Venezuela, it means that the new leaders of Venezuela need to meet our demands,\" including ceasing drugs and weapons trafficking, Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton told CNN on Sunday morning.\n\n\"We want them to expel the Cubans and the Iranians and the Islamic radicals, and we want them to return to the civilized world and be a good neighbor that contributes to stability, order and prosperity,\" the Arkansas Republican said.\n\nBehind the scenes, US officials have zeroed in on Rodr\u00edguez, who they believed could provide a stable transition, offer a more professional relationship than Maduro -- and, perhaps most importantly, ensure future American energy investments were protected.\n\nTrump issued a threat against Rodr\u00edguez on Sunday, saying in an interview with The Atlantic, \"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"\n\nThe administration appears to have written off the opposition leader, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Some advisers have warned Trump for months that Machado was not a guaranteed bet and was untested in power. One source told CNN that Trump was never fully sold on Machado, though there were early conversations discussing what the country might look like with her at the helm.\n\nDespite Machado's previous attempts to appeal to Trump, he claimed Saturday she lacked the \"respect\" needed to lead Venezuela. Instead, Trump said Rodr\u00edguez -- a member of a regime the US previously said was illegitimate -- would hold power in Caracas as long as she \"does what we want,\" vowing to launch a second round of strikes if she didn't accede.\n\nLater in the day, Rodr\u00edguez showed few signs of submission, declaring Maduro was still the head of state and describing the US operation to capture him as \"barbarity.\"\n\nAmerican officials viewed the comments as targeted toward an internal audience, and appeared nonplussed that she appeared to be publicly rebuffing Trump's claims that she was now in charge.\n\nIn her Sunday night comments, Rodr\u00edguez spoke directly to the US president, writing, \"President Donald Trump: our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war. This has always been President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's message, and it is a message of all Venezuela right now.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Rubio said the US would judge Rodr\u00edguez on what she does moving forward, rather than her past statements.\n\n\"We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what we know what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward,\" he said.\n\nRubio declined to provide details about his conversations with Rodr\u00edguez, but told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that \"we expect to see more compliance and cooperation than we were previously receiving.\"\n\nTwo former senior State Department officials said Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez would likely only have made or would make a deal with the Trump administration if it offered protection for leadership.\n\n\"For Delcy, she's not going to put her head on the block and say, 'Hack away,'\" said one former official who knows her. \"Any deal that's going to be done has to be done in a way that is going to offer some degree of protection to the leadership.\" This official described Rodr\u00edguez as a \"very committed leftist,\" and told CNN they do not think the officials who committed their lives to the cause would so easily give it up to become \"lackeys.\"\n\n\"I would think that they're going to ask for a lot of guarantees,\" said the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nTodd Robinson, who served as acting US ambassador to Venezuela during Trump's first term, said Rodr\u00edguez may agree to a deal with the administration on \"the hope that she can stay and somehow stay in charge of the political apparatus that is there.\" If she is not able to stay in power, Robinson said, she may agree a deal if it allows her \"to leave under her own auspices with whatever they've socked away in whatever bank accounts they have outside of Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I think we'll see whether the vice president of Venezuela, who is sanctioned by the United States and many other countries, who was in league and hand-chosen by Maduro, wants to turn over a new leaf,\" Cotton said.\n\nUnmentioned, at least by Trump this weekend, was whether he sought a return to democracy in Venezuela, which for years has been run by authoritarians. Rubio on Sunday said the US wants to see a democratic transition in Venezuela, but argued the administration \"needs to deal with the immediately reality.\" He said discussing a potential timeline for elections in Venezuela was \"premature.\"\n\n\"We have short-term things that have to be addressed right away. We all wish to see a bright future for Venezuela, transition to democracy,\" he said on NBC.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2026 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "title": "Rubio Attempts to Clarify Trump Claim That U.S. Will 'Run' Venezuela: What to Know",
      "body": "The Trump Administration, which for months denied seeking regime change in Venezuela, is moving to assert control over the country's political future.\n\nThe U.S. carried out a series of strikes on the Venezuelan mainland on Saturday, killing at least 40 people and capturing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom the U.S. considered an illegitimate President. Maduro was taken to New York, along with his wife, to face drug charges, leaving the Latin American country's leadership in question.\n\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=\"true\"]\n\nRead More: A President Captured: How the Elite Delta Force Raid in Caracas Unfolded\n\n\"Don't ask me who's in charge, because I'll give you an answer, and it'll be very controversial,\" President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night. \"We're in charge.\"\n\n\"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,\" Trump said Saturday, signalling longer-term U.S. involvement in the country.\n\nRead More: Donald Trump Is Risking His MAGA Base on Venezuela\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who has led the Administration's policy on Venezuela, seemed to try to clarify to NBC on Sunday that the U.S. is seeking a democratic transition in Venezuela but that a timeline for elections would be \"premature.\" Rubio also insisted that the U.S.'s military operations against Venezuela -- which have consisted of months of strikes on alleged drug boats that have killed at least 115 people -- do not constitute a war, which would require congressional authorization.\n\nOfficials have suggested that the U.S. government will leverage American military presence and an oil blockade to influence the direction of the Venezuelan government, including ending drug trafficking, increasing U.S. access to Venezuelan oil, and expelling Cuban elements. A U.S. official told CNN that Rubio, alongside White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and War Secretary Pete Hegseth, is developing a structure for an interim government in the country, while Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright are working on persuading American oil companies to invest in Venezuela's deteriorating and long-sanctioned oil industry.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nThe deposition of Maduro has already led to a scramble for power among Venezuelan opposition leaders. Venezuelan opposition figure Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, who is recognized by the U.S. as the winner of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election, called himself the President of Venezuela in a video posted Sunday. Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, the recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, has thrown her support behind him, as have some foreign leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nRead More: How the World Is Reacting to the U.S. Capture of Nicolas Maduro\n\nUrrutia must be \"recognized as Commander in Chief of the National Armed Forces by all officers and soldiers,\" Machado said on Saturday.\n\nMachado, who has close ties with Trump and has cheered his Administration's military campaign against the Maduro government, was thought to be a potential replacement for Maduro. But the U.S. President ruled her out on Saturday, suggesting that she does not command enough \"respect within the country\" needed to govern it.\n\nInstead, for now, the Trump Administration appears to be backing Maduro's Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nThat backing, however, is contingent, Trump said Saturday, on Rodr\u00edguez doing \"what we want.\" He warned on Sunday: \"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"\n\n\"When the President said the United States is going to be running Venezuela, it means that the new leaders of Venezuela need to meet our demands,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton told CNN on Sunday. \"We want them to expel the Cubans and the Iranians and the Islamic radicals, and we want them to return to the civilized world and be a good neighbor that contributes to stability, order and prosperity.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez was not immediately pliant. After Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as Venezuela's new leader, she asserted that Maduro is the country's \"only President\" and called the U.S. military operation \"barbarity.\"\n\n\"We had already warned that an aggression was underway under false excuses and false pretenses, and that the masks had fallen off, revealing only one objective: regime change in Venezuela,\" Rodr\u00edguez said. \"This regime change would also allow for the seizure of our energy, mineral and natural resources. This is the true objective, and the world and the international community must know it.\"\n\nA former official familiar with Rodr\u00edguez told CNN that she is a \"very committed leftist\" and would not \"put her head on the block and say, 'Hack away.'\"\n\nStill, the Trump Administration appears confident that Rodr\u00edguez will be more amenable to the U.S.\n\n\"We're going to control what happens next because of this brave decision. President Trump has shown American leadership, and he'll be able to dictate where we go next,\" Hegseth told CBS on Saturday.\n\n\"We expect to see more compliance and cooperation than we were previously receiving,\" Rubio told NBC on Sunday. \"We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what we know what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward,\" Rubio told CBS on Sunday.\n\nRodr\u00edguez already appeared to soften her tone Sunday night in a social media statement that said her government extends \"an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperative agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence.\"\n\nWhen asked what it meant for the U.S. to \"run\" Venezuela -- and under what legal authority -- Rubio suggested that the U.S. was not directly in charge of the country, but had power over its \"direction.\"\n\n\"What we are running is the direction that this is going to move moving forward,\" he told ABC on Sunday. \"And that is, we have leverage.\"\n\nRead More: How Trump's Venezuela Takeover Could Change the World\n\nThat includes an ongoing U.S. blockade of oil tankers going in and out of Venezuela. \"The important thing to point out is that the key to what that regime relies on is the economy fueled by oil,\" Rubio told CBS. \"There's a quarantine right now in which sanctioned oil shipments -- there's a boat, and that boat is under U.S. sanctions, we go get a court order -- we will seize it.\"\n\nOil has historically accounted for more than 80% of Venezuela's exports. Experts previously suggested that cutting off this economic lifeline would amount to an \"act of war.\"\n\nRubio said the oil blockade will continue \"until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.\"\n\nThe Trump Administration is also acting on its interest in forcing unfettered access to Venezuela's oil industry, which the Maduro government had alleged was the reason behind U.S. military aggression towards Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela is home to the world's largest oil reserves, but its oil industry has been hit by sanctions and riddled with problems from corruption to fires that have dramatically reduced its output. The country produces around one million barrels of oil per day, down from peak levels of around four million barrels 50 years ago.\n\nThe Trump Administration is hoping that U.S. companies will rebuild Venezuela's oil industry.\n\n\"Venezuela right now is a dead country. We have to bring it back, and we're going to have to have big investments by the oil companies to bring back the infrastructure ready to go,\" Trump said on Sunday night.\n\nSome analysts, however, are skeptical of the feasibility of this plan. \"For any oil companies to actually get serious about investing in Venezuela would require that there will be a new congress or National Assembly,\" Lino Carrillo, a former manager at Venezuela's state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, told Bloomberg. \"Not what's happening now. Definitely not.\"\n\nFrancisco Monaldi, director of Latin American energy policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, told Bloomberg that Trump's plan could require investments to the tune of $100 billion over the next decade.\n\nChevron is the only U.S. oil producer still operating in Venezuela under a special license issued by former President Joe Biden exempting it from U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil. Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, the two other biggest U.S. oil companies, exited Venezuela after former Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Maduro's predecessor, nationalized the oil industry nearly two decades ago.\n\n\"I haven't spoken to U.S. oil companies in the last few days, but we're pretty certain that there will be dramatic interest,\" Rubio told ABC on Sunday. \"I think there will be tremendous demand and interest from private industry if given the space to do it.\"\n\nTrump also warned that further military action is still on the table.\n\n\"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind,\" Trump said at a news conference in Florida on Saturday.\n\n\"We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,\" he added. \"We're not afraid of boots on the ground.\"\n\nTrump reiterated the point aboard Air Force One on Sunday, telling reporters of the Venezuelan government: \"If they don't behave, we will do a second strike.\"",

      "body": "Venezuela's military high command on Sunday formally recognized Delcy Rodriguez as the nation's acting president, following the lawless abduction of democratically elected leader Nicolas Maduro by US forces.\n\nThe transition, aimed at maintaining sovereign continuity, comes as the international community reels from a shocking US-led assault on the Venezuelan capital, condemned as a blatant act of state-sponsored terrorism.\n\nDefense Minister Vladimir Padrino delivered the announcement via national television, endorsing a Supreme Court ruling that appoints Rodriguez as acting leader for 90 days.\n\nPadrino described the assault as a \"cowardly kidnapping,\" revealing that Maduro's security detail was murdered \"in cold blood\" alongside military personnel and civilians during the American strikes.\n\n\"The homeland must follow its constitutional course,\" Padrino declared, calling on the Venezuelan people to resume economic and educational activities as a form of resistance against the chaos intended by Washington.\n\nWhile an official death toll from the US bombings has yet to be finalized, authorities confirmed that the strikes targeted the heart of Caracas, violating all norms of international law.\n\nWashington issues Mafia-style threats\n\nShortly after the transition was announced, US President Donald Trump shifted from a posture of diplomacy to open intimidation.\n\nTrump threatened that Rodriguez would pay a \"very big price\" if she refused to surrender Venezuela's sovereignty to American interests.\n\nTrump had earlier indicated that Rodriguez was a figure Washington could work with.\n\nWhile US officials have attempted to justify the kidnapping using \"narcotrafficking\" allegations in a New York court, the Trump administration has simultaneously admitted its true motive-- access to Venezuela's massive crude oil reserves.\n\nFollowing the Saturday morning raid, which involved over 150 US aircraft, the Supreme Court moved swiftly to appoint Rodriguez to ensure \"administrative continuity.\"\n\nThe assault is viewed by Caracas as the latest and most violent attempt in a decade-long US campaign to topple the Bolivarian Revolution.\n\nIn a televised address late Saturday, Rodriguez demanded the immediate release of President Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were flown to a US detention facility in New York.\n\nRodriguez characterized the operation as having a \"Zionist tint,\" suggesting the strategic involvement or tactical influence of Israeli regime forces in the American aggression.\n\n\"The governments of the world are shocked that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is the victim of an attack of this nature,\" Rodriguez stated.",

      "title": "Maduro gone, but regime intact",
      "body": "Even as he remained imprisoned at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, yesterday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime appeared to remain intact at home.\n\nThere were calls from that country's leaders for his immediate release from US custody and a rejection of Washington's assertions that it would assume control of the South American country.\n\nOne day after US President Donald Trump confirmed that the US had conducted a large-scale attack on the country, removing Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores from their compound in Caracas and transporting them both to the US where they are indicted on criminal charges, Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez held a news conference calling for their immediate release, and throwing support behind Vice President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez, constitutionally in line to replace Maduro in the event of his absence, was on Saturday night elevated to acting President, decrying Maduro's apprehension and repeating prior claims that the US had intervened to gain control of the country's vast oil wealth.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, Padrino, who is in charge of the country's military, further condemned Maduro's extraction, stating that the country's sovereignty had been violated. He said Maduro was constitutionally elected and that the Bolivarian National Armed Forces demanded his immediate release. \"This is an act of profound outrage, a profound offence not only against the legitimate president of Venezuela, but also against a woman of Christian values (Maduro's wife Cilia Flores), a woman of principles, who was also taken away in handcuffs.\n\n\"We appeal to the world, we ask the world to look closely at everything that is happening against Venezuela, against its sovereignty, against its Constitution...Let the world put its guard up, because this represents a severe threat to the global order. If today it is against Venezuela, tomorrow it could be against any State, against any country, under a colonialist pretence that seeks to be imposed in the spirit of the Monroe Doctrine over Latin America and the Caribbean. We reject this from here,\" he said.\n\n'We will never again be slaves'\n\nShortly after Trump stated that the United States would be running Venezuela and maintaining a presence via its oil companies until a safe and judicious transition out of the Maduro-regime rule could be facilitated, Rodriguez appeared flanked by Maduro-regime officials such as Diosdado Cabello, and Padrino, declaring that the country had only one president in Maduro.\n\nDuring his announcement of the US extraction, Trump himself did not provide direct answers on how the country planned to do so, its standing with current politicians or the potential of US troops being stationed on the ground, but claimed that Rodriguez was willing to \"make Venezuela great again.\"\n\nHe said that Rodriguez had spoken to Rubio, and that a team, comprising those in proximity to him, would be tasked with running the country. He also warned Venezuelan politicians that they, too, could meet Maduro's fate.\n\n\"I understand she was just sworn in but she was, as you know, picked by Maduro. So Marco is working on that directly. He just had a conversation with her and she is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" he said.\n\nMoments later at a news conference of her own, Rodriguez called the US action an attempt to seize the country's vast mineral and oil wealth, stating, \"If there is one thing the Venezuelan people and this country understand with absolute clarity, it is that we will never again be slaves, that we will never again be a colony of any empire, of whatever kind it may be.\"\n\nAs he spoke yesterday, reading from a release on behalf of the Bolivarian Armed Forces, Padrino said that the body supported a decree of a state of external emergency throughout the national territory, and acknowledged Rodriguez's acting capacity.\n\nHe said an operation had been undertaken to \"confront imperial aggression\".\n\n\"In this same sense, the Bolivarian Government will guarantee the governability of the country, and our institution will continue to employ all its available capabilities for military defence, the maintenance of internal order, and the preservation of peace.\n\n\"Therefore, we activate throughout the entire national geographic space and in perfect popular-military-police unity, the Operation Ready Combat Deployment, in order to integrate the elements of National Power in the mission of confronting imperial aggression, forming a single combat block to ensure the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of the Nation,\" he said.",

      "title": "Trump warns defiant Delcy",
      "body": "Less than a day after she defiantly pushed back against the United States' military intervention in Venezuela that saw its president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife captured, US President Donald Trump warned Venezuelan acting President Delcy Rodriguez she could face a worse fate.\n\nThe Atlantic Magazine yesterday reported that Trump, in an interview from his West Palm Beach Golf Club, said he would not stand for Rodr\u00edguez's resistance to US actions in the South American country, stating, \"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"\n\nJust hours after his capture was confirmed by Trump on Saturday, Rodriguez decried the US extraction operation, stating that the \"mask\" had fallen and that the \"empire\" was after Venezuela's oil wealth.\n\nTrump claimed on Saturday that the US would be running Venezuela, and that its oil companies would be present, rebuilding failed infrastructure and accessing untapped oil reserves from which both the US and Venezuela would benefit.\n\nHe did not elaborate on how the US planned to oversee the country, but said Rodriguez had appeared compliant while speaking to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n\"He just had a conversation with her and she is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" he had said.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, a Maduro-regime loyalist and a familiar and at times outspoken figure in relations with Trinidad and Tobago, was elevated by the country's court late Saturday to acting President.\n\nThe move followed the capture of Maduro by United States forces and his transfer to the US to face criminal charges in New York today.\n\nHer elevation was ordered by Venezuela's Supreme Tribunal of Justice, the country's highest court, during a late-afternoon broadcast nationwide, Magistrate and president of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of Venezuela, Tania D'Amelio, stated that the court had decided that Rodriguez will now assume all the powers, duties and faculties inherent to the office of the President.\n\nBy the Chamber's decision, Rodriguez's elevation is for the purpose of \"guaranteeing administrative continuity and the comprehensive defence of the nation\".\n\nFollowing his announcement of Maduro's pre-dawn apprehension by US military forces in Caracas on Saturday morning, D'Amelio referred to Maduro's capture as a kidnapping.\n\nShe said the body, the highest constitutional authority, considered Maduro's capture exceptional, atypical, of force majeure, not expressly foreseen in the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. As a result, she said the Chamber had deemed it important to institute a protective measure to guarantee administrative continuity of the State.\n\nRodriguez, 56, has been a key figure in Maduro's regime since his assumption of power in 2013, viewed as a loyal and avid supporter of the regime.\n\nShe was born in Caracas in May 1969, a daughter to a left-wing Marxist leader Jorge Antonio Rodriguez. Her father, who founded the Socialist League party, was arrested and died in police custody while being questioned on his role in the kidnapping of an American businessman.\n\nShe is an attorney, formerly serving under Maduro as communication and information minister from 2013 to 2014 and foreign affairs minister from 2014 to 2017 -- the first woman to serve in this role.\n\nShe was again elevated by Maduro in 2018 to the Vice-Presidency, expanding as Minister of Economy in 2020. Rodriguez's brother, Jorge Rodriguez, is the president of Venezuela's National Assembly and a political adviser to Maduro.\n\nFraught relations with T&T\n\nIn her capacity as Vice-President Rodriguez has long interacted with Trinidad and Tobago, negotiating with then-minister of energy and former prime minister Stuart Young on the joint development of the Dragon and Cocuina-Manakin gas fields within the countries' maritime borders. At one point during the Covid-19 pandemic, she travelled to Trinidad to meet with the former government.\n\nAmid the Trump administration's naval build-up over the past four months and Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar's welcoming of US actions, Rodriguez's relations with the country took a turn.\n\nRodriguez condemned Persad-Bissessar's statements and later recommended the scrapping oil and gas deals between the two countries.\n\nWhen the US struck the first of multiple vessels traversing the Caribbean Sea killing 11, the Prime Minister had praised the US operation and said that they should kill all drug traffickers violently. As relatives claimed two Trinidadian fishermen were believed to be killed in the US' fifth strike, Rodriguez called Persad-Bissessar's statements \"self-fulfilling prophecy\".\n\nShe had earlier warned the country, saying \"do not dare\" allow the US to use its territory to launch an attack on Venezuela.\n\nRodriguez had also earlier pushed back against claims by Minister in the Ministry of Housing Phillip Edward Alexander that India would \"nuke\" Venezuela in defence of Trinidad and Tobago, stating that a \"nuclear bomb\" had exploded in his government's brain.\n\n\"Trinidad and Tobago should think of its people before they intend to attack Venezuela and renounce their vassalage to the US government that intends to steal our immense energy resources. They could not and will not with our determination to freedom and self-determination, widely exercised in our diplomacy of peace,\" wrote Rodriguez.",

      "title": "Global chaos - Trump: We have control, Venezuela is a dead country, targets include Colombia, Iran, and we will take Greenland",
      "body": "A series of nations and leaders have unequivocally condemned the actions of the United States, characterizing them as a blatant violation of international law and a dangerous precedent.\n\nThe US strike was anything but surgical, with over 80 reported dead and extensive destruction. The American military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the arrest and extraction of President Nicolas Maduro, has caused more than just a political earthquake in Caracas. It has triggered a deep and open rupture in the international community, bringing a fundamental question to the fore: are we witnessing the end of international law or the reaffirmation of an order based on power and \"freedom\" as defined by the West?\n\nFollowing the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, US President Trump stated that the United States now controls Venezuela, threatened to use force against Colombia and Iran, and reiterated the need to annex Greenland. \"Don't ask me who's in charge here, because I'll tell you, and the answer will be very convincing. We are in charge here,\" Trump declared. Trump called Venezuela a \"dead country,\" stating that the United States must rebuild it. He claimed that American oil companies are eager to work in Venezuela and will invest in the country's infrastructure.\n\nOther statements by the American president included: -- \"Abduction\" is the appropriate word for the operation to arrest Nicolas Maduro; -- The operation against Venezuela was \"quick, brutal,\" and \"very violent\"; -- Nicolas Maduro surrendered \"immediately\" to American troops; -- Elections in Venezuela will be held when the time is right; -- All Americans injured during the US operation in Venezuela are \"in good condition\"; -- The presence of US troops in Venezuela depends on further developments; -- The United States is considering opening an embassy in Caracas; -- The attack on Venezuela will not affect US relations with China; -- Colombia is run by a \"sick person\" who produces cocaine; the US may carry out an operation against that country; -- Cuba is ready to fall; -- The United States needs Greenland; -- From a defensive standpoint, the European Union needs the United States to possess this island.\n\nReactions worldwide were intense and revealing of today's multipolar world of conflicting narratives and increasingly contested international legitimacy. The number of victims from the US military operation in Venezuela stands at 80 dead, according to a report by the New York Times. The operation, which took place on January 3, 2026, and resulted in the arrest of President Nicolas Maduro, caused extensive destruction and loss of life, particularly in the capital, Caracas, and at military installations. The report notes that the death toll may rise further as the assessment of the aerial strikes continues. The number of dead contradicts US authorities' claims that the strike was supposedly perfectly surgical with no casualties. Meanwhile, Maduro is expected to be brought before a court in New York on Monday, January 5, 2026, where he will be formally charged, according to a Washington Post report.\n\nThese losses intensify international reactions and accusations of disproportionate use of force, while bringing back the debate over the legitimacy of the intervention and its humanitarian impact. This development adds new weight to the already acute international confrontation surrounding the events in Venezuela and increases pressure on Washington for explanations regarding the human cost of the operation.\n\nUS President Donald Trump warned that Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, will pay a \"very high price\" if she does not make the \"right decisions,\" in an interview with The Atlantic. \"If Delcy Rodriguez doesn't do the right thing, she will pay very dearly -- possibly even more dearly than Maduro,\" Trump stated, escalating his rhetoric following the recent events. Trump also revealed that he had a telephone conversation with Maduro about a week before the military operation, urging him to surrender -- a proposal the Venezuelan leader rejected. Washington, through the President and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has made it clear that it expects the new leadership to move in accordance with American demands for the country's transitional period.\n\nMeanwhile, the decision of the Supreme Court of Venezuela to appoint Vice President Delcy Rodriguez as interim head of state marks a critical turning point in the conflict between national sovereignty and external imposition. At a time when the country's elected president, Nicolas Maduro, is in US custody following military intervention, Caracas is attempting to respond not with chaos, but by invoking the Constitution. The Supreme Court justified its decision as necessary to maintain constitutional order, referring to the \"abduction\" of the sitting president. This phrasing is not merely legal; it is deeply political. It implies that Venezuela does not recognize the legitimacy of American actions and treats the situation as a product of external violence rather than an internal crisis of power.\n\nThe decision is based on Article 239, paragraph 6 of the Venezuelan Constitution, which stipulates that in the event of the president's temporary absence, the vice president assumes duties for 90 days, with a possible 90-day extension by the National Assembly. With this move, the country's institutions are attempting to close the power vacuum before it becomes a pretext for external \"management.\" It is no coincidence that the Supreme Court requested the immediate briefing of the Armed Forces, the National Defense Council, the top military leadership, and the National Assembly. The message is clear: the state is functioning, the chain of command remains active, and power is not being surrendered into a void.\n\nDonald Trump had previously stated that the United States could take over the governance of Venezuela during the transition period -- unless Rodriguez \"carries out the will of Washington.\" This is a blunt formulation that reveals the true dilemma posed by the US: submission or replacement. Rodriguez's response was immediate and categorical. She stated that Venezuela \"will not become a colony,\" demanded Maduro's release, and pledged to protect the country's natural resources. This rhetoric is aimed not only at the domestic audience but also at the international community, attempting to frame the conflict as a struggle for independence against a modern form of imperialism.\n\nA series of states and leaders unequivocally condemned the actions of the United States, characterizing them as a blatant violation of international law and a dangerous precedent. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic was among the most direct. He stated that after the events in Venezuela, it became clear that international law and the UN Charter no longer function, as the world is dominated by \"the right of the strong.\" According to him, this development forces states to reconsider their security -- which explains Serbia's decision to drastically increase its military capabilities. A similar stance was taken by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who publicly condemned the violation of international laws, underlining that such actions undermine the international order.\n\nThe reaction from Cuba was particularly harsh. President Miguel Diaz-Canel described Maduro's arrest as an act of state terrorism and explicitly rejected the Monroe Doctrine, stating that Latin America is no one's \"backyard.\" His statement highlighted the conflict as an existential battle for the region's independence. Beijing, through the Foreign Ministry, stated it was \"shocked\" by the use of US military force against a sovereign state, emphasizing that such actions threaten peace and stability in Latin America and the Caribbean. Brazilian President Lula da Silva spoke of an extremely dangerous precedent, warning that the normalization of such attacks is the first step toward a world of chaos, instability, and raw power.\n\nMoscow characterized the American operation as an act of armed aggression, rejecting arguments for \"legitimization\" through charges against Maduro. The Russian Foreign Ministry underlined that Venezuela has the inalienable right to determine its future without external, and particularly military, interference. Belarus, through President Alexander Lukashenko, expressed full solidarity with the people of Venezuela, warning that a long-term conflict could evolve into a \"second Vietnam\" for the United States.\n\nOn the other hand, several states supported Washington's actions, adopting the narrative of \"liberation from dictatorship.\" Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated that \"if Maduro were a good leader, this wouldn't have happened,\" implying the responsibility lies solely with him. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar described the operation as \"historical,\" praising Donald Trump as the \"leader of the free world\" and stating that Israel stands by the people of Venezuela. Ukraine, through Foreign Minister Andriy Sibiga, stressed that it did not recognize the previous elections in Venezuela and that the country's people are entitled to security, prosperity, and dignity. French President Emmanuel Macron stated that Venezuela was \"freed from dictatorship,\" expressing hope for a peaceful transition under new leadership. In the same vein, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke of being rid of a brutal dictatorship, noting that now is not the time to examine whether the US actions are legal.\n\nOn the night of January 3, the US launched Operation \"Absolute Resolve\", hitting targets in Caracas and arresting Maduro and his wife. The charges of \"narco-terrorism\" and the plan to hold the trial in the US gave the operation a criminal veneer, but without international consensus. Trump stated that the US is ready to take over the governance of Venezuela during the transition period, even with the deployment of troops. The country's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, replied that Venezuela will not become a colony and declared a state of emergency, characterizing the intervention as military aggression.\n\nThe case of Venezuela has revealed something deeper than a regional crisis. It has revealed a world divided between two irreconcilable perceptions: on one hand, the principle of state sovereignty and international law; on the other, the belief that power and a \"moral mission\" legitimize unilateral action. Whether this intervention will be seen in the future as a restoration of \"freedom\" or as the definitive confirmation of \"the right of the strong\" will be judged not only in Venezuela, but in the overall course of the international order in the coming years.",

Trump has previously said she was willing to work with the United States. Publicly, however, Rodr\u00edguez and other senior officials have continued to describe the detention of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, as a \"kidnapping\" and have insisted that Maduro remains the country's legitimate leader.\n\nThe statement came a day after Trump warned that the US could launch another strike if Venezuela failed to cooperate with Washington's efforts to open up its oil industry and curb drug trafficking. Speaking to reporters, Trump also threatened military action in Colombia and Mexico, and said Cuba's communist government appeared close to collapse. The Colombian and Mexican embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRodr\u00edguez's outreach came on the eve of Maduro's scheduled appearance on Monday before a federal judge in New York. The Trump administration has portrayed his seizure as a law-enforcement action to enforce criminal charges first filed in 2020, which accuse Maduro of conspiring to engage in narco-terrorism.\n\nUS prosecutors allege that Maduro provided support to major drug trafficking organisations, including the Sinaloa Cartel and the Tren de Aragua, directed cocaine trafficking routes, used the military to protect shipments and allowed presidential facilities to be used for moving narcotics. The charges were updated on Saturday to include Flores, who is accused of ordering kidnappings and murders. Maduro has denied all allegations, and US officials have said it could take months before his trial begins.",

      "body": "Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who was captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) -- As uncertainty simmers in Venezuela, interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation, and offered \"to collaborate\" with the Trump administration in what could be a seismic shift in relations between the adversary governments.\n\nRodr\u00edguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela's oil-dependent economy and its feared intelligence service, and was next in the presidential line of succession.\n\nShe's part of a band of senior officials in Maduro's administration that now appears to control Venezuela, even as U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials say they will pressure the government to fall in line with its vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela's high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, and the leader was backed by Venezuela's military.\n\nAlly or adversary\n\nRodr\u00edguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and politician has had a lengthy career representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez on the world stage. It's been unclear if the leader would warm up to the Trump administration or follow the same adversarial line as her predecessor.\n\nHer rise to become interim leader of the South American country came as a surprise on Saturday morning, when Trump announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in communication with Rodr\u00edguez and that the Venezuelan leader was \"gracious\" and would work with the American government. Rubio said Rodr\u00edguez was someone the administration could work with, unlike Maduro.\n\nBut in a televised address, Rodr\u00edguez gave no indication that she would cooperate with Trump, referring to his government as \"extremists\" and maintaining that Maduro was Venezuela's rightful leader.\n\n\"What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\" Rodr\u00edguez said, surrounded by high-ranking civilian officials and military leaders.\n\nTrump warned on Sunday, if Rodr\u00edguez didn't fall in line, \"she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\" He added that he wanted her to provide \"total access,\" from oil facilities to basic infrastructure like roads, so they can be rebuilt.\n\nTrump's comments also followed Rubio having asserted in TV interviews on Sunday that he didn't see Rodr\u00edguez and her government as \"legitimate\" because he said the country never held free and fair elections.\n\nOn Sunday, in statements posted to her Instagram, she took a major shift in tone in a conciliatory message where she said she hoped to build \"respectful relations\" with Trump.\n\n\"We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\" she wrote.\n\nRise to interim president\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, the interim president and her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who was arrested for his involvement in the kidnapping of American business owner William Niehous in 1976, and later died in police custody.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro's inner circle, the Rodr\u00edguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S., though the interim president did face U.S. sanctions during Trump's first term for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nRodr\u00edguez held a number of lower-level positions under Ch\u00e1vez's government, but gained prominence working under Maduro to the point of being seen as his successor. She served the economic minister, foreign affairs minister, petroleum minister and others help stabilize Venezuela's endemically crisis-stricken economy after years of rampant inflation and turmoil.\n\nRodr\u00edguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. The interim president also presided over an assembly promoted by Maduro in response to street protests in 2017 meant to neutralize the opposition-majority legislature.\n\nShe enjoys a close relationship with the military, which has long acted as the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, said Ronal Rodr\u00edguez, a spokesperson for the Venezuela Observatory of Rosario University in Bogota, Colombia.\n\n\"She has a very particular relationship with power,\" he said. \"She has developed very strong ties with elements of the armed forces and has managed to establish lines of dialogue with them, largely on a transactional basis.\"\n\nFuture in power\n\nIt's unclear how long Rodr\u00edguez will hold power, or how closely she will work with the Trump administration.\n\nGeoff Ramsey, a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute, said Rodr\u00edguez's initially firm tone with the Trump administration may have been an attempt to \"save face.\" Others have noted that Maduro's capture required some level of collaboration within the Venezuelan government.\n\n\"She can't exactly expect to score points with her revolutionary peers if she presents herself as a patsy for U.S. interests,\" Ramsey said.\n\nVenezuela's constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes \"permanently unavailable\" to serve. Reasons listed include death, resignation, removal from office or \"abandonment\" of duties as declared by the National Assembly.\n\nThat electoral timeline was rigorously followed when Maduro's predecessor, Chavez, died of cancer in 2013. However, the loyalist Supreme Court, in its decision Saturday, cited another provision of the charter in declaring Maduro's absence a \"temporary\" one.\n\nIn such a scenario, there is no election requirement. Instead, the vice president, an unelected position, takes over for up to 90 days -- a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nIn handing temporary power to Rodr\u00edguez, the Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day time limit, leading some to speculate she could try to remain in power even longer as she seeks to unite the disparate factions of the ruling socialist party while shielding it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.\n\n-- -- Janetsky reported from Mexico City and Debre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

      "title": "Who is Venezuela's acting leader, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez?",
      "body": "Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, has taken over as acting leader in the wake of a U.S. raid that deposed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro over the weekend.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56, is a veteran politician, lawyer and diplomat who has played a key role in overhauling Venezuela's economic policy, developing close ties with the business community.\n\nVenezuela's Supreme Court ordered her late Saturday to assume the presidency in Maduro's absence, a position she would hold on an interim basis. On Sunday, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez also recognized Rodr\u00edguez as acting president, saying in televised remarks that the nation's forces must be unified in \"the mission of confronting imperial aggression.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez's first public comments came Saturday when, in an address to the nation, she denounced the U.S. operation to take Maduro and said he is the country's only president.\n\nBut in a Sunday night statement, Rodr\u00edguez offered a more conciliatory message, calling for \"peaceful coexistence.\"\n\n\"President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war,\" Rodr\u00edguez said. \"This has always been President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's message, and it is the message of all of Venezuela right now.\"\n\nEarlier, President Donald Trump suggested Rodr\u00edguez was willing to work with the United States, which he said would \"run\" Venezuela. But on Sunday, he threatened the vice president in an interview with the Atlantic, saying that \"if she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"\n\nHere's what we know about the interim Venezuelan leader.\n\nRodr\u00edguez is a Caracas native and was born in the Venezuelan capital in 1969.\n\nShe was 7 years old when her father, leftist political leader and guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, was killed while under interrogation by counterintelligence agents for his alleged role in the abduction of an American executive in Caracas.\n\nHis death left an indelible mark on Rodr\u00edguez and her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez G\u00f3mez, 60, who is president of Venezuela's National Assembly, according to a 2020 profile in Vanity Fair Espa\u00f1a.\n\nAfter growing up in a deeply socialist family and hearing tales about their father, the siblings embarked on lifelong political careers, embedding themselves in the country's leftist politics and serving in key roles under Venezuela's former firebrand president and socialist icon, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and his handpicked successor, Maduro.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, who often wears black-rimmed glasses and bright-colored fabrics, was educated in Caracas, Paris and London, studying law at the Central University of Venezuela, where she later worked as professor. She started her professional career as a labor lawyer and joined the Ch\u00e1vez administration in 2003.\n\nRodr\u00edguez's political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stretches back over two decades, during which she held positions that led her to the upper echelons of power.\n\nShe started in the office of the general coordinator for the vice president in 2003, moving then to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, where she served as director of international affairs.\n\nLater, she became minister of presidential affairs under Ch\u00e1vez in 2006.\n\nShe was a fierce defender of Ch\u00e1vez's Bolivarian Revolution -- named after 19th-century Venezuelan revolutionary Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar -- which envisioned social and political reforms that would lift millions out of poverty and build a Latin America free of U.S. influence.\n\n\"She has defended Venezuelan sovereignty, peace and independence like a tiger,\" Maduro said of Rodr\u00edguez in 2017.\n\nBut even as Ch\u00e1vez sought to fund social welfare programs, he let the country's strategic petroleum reserves dwindle and made authoritarian moves that stifled the press and gutted the nation's stable of experts.\n\nAfter Chavez died in 2013, Maduro elevated Rodr\u00edguez to minister of popular power for communication and information -- and appointed her as his top diplomat and foreign minister the next year.\n\nWhen the price of oil plummeted in 2014, it set off economic chaos in Venezuela, characterized by severe food shortages, runaway inflation and an exodus from the country.\n\nOn the heels of that collapse, in 2018, Rodr\u00edguez became Maduro's vice president (while serving later as finance minister and minister of oil). A few months afterward, the U.S. placed sanctions on Rodr\u00edguez, her brother and other members of Maduro's inner circle, accusing them of corruption and human rights abuses.\n\n\"The revolution is our revenge for the death of our father and his executioners,\" Rodr\u00edguez said in an interview that year with Venezuelan journalist Jos\u00e9 Vicente Rangel.\n\nWith her broad portfolio, Rodr\u00edguez sought to implement economic reforms while maintaining state control over key sectors and continuing to prioritize social spending.\n\nShe has been viewed generally as more pragmatic and willing to oversee a limited opening of Venezuela's economy than hard-line government officials, including the defense and interior ministers.\n\nTrump said Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez had spoken to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \"She said, 'We'll do whatever you need,'\" he added. \"I think she was quite gracious,\" Trump said. \"But she really doesn't have a choice.\"\n\nIn some of her first actions as acting president, Rodr\u00edguez announced the creation of two commissions in a statement published by Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez. The first is a high-level panel dedicated to the release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The second will focus on guaranteeing and consolidating \"food sovereignty and supply projects\" in Venezuela, the statement said.\n\nRodr\u00edguez also visited people who were injured in the U.S. attacks that deposed Maduro, according to the statement, referring to them as \"brave and heroic young people who stood up to defend our sovereignty and the integrity of our President, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez and her brother are seen as modernizers who want a semi-open country and economy and warmer relations with the broader world, Tulane University sociologist David Smilde said.\n\nThe siblings, however, \"don't have guns,\" said Phil Gunson, a senior analyst for the Andes region with the International Crisis Group. And even with Delcy Rodr\u00edguez as interim president, the interior and defense ministers could still hold most of the power, given their control of the military and security forces.\n\n\"If it comes to a fight, they're left hanging because they don't have anyone to back them,\" Gunson said. \"What I suspect is going to happen is, she will occupy the presidency, but the powers will be the defense and interior ministers, and that's not good.\"",

He added that the number could rise further.\n\nExplosions had rocked Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, early Saturday.\n\nHours later, US President Donald Trump announced on social media that his country had successfully captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference following the attack, Trump said the US will take over the affairs of Venezuela until a political transition is achieved.\n\n\"We don't want to be involved with having somebody else get in and end up with the same situation we've had for a long period of years,\" he said, adding that any transition \"has to be judicious, because that's what we're all about\".\n\nTrump described the strike as \"an incredible thing to see\", saying no American soldiers were killed and no military equipment was lost during the operation.\n\nMeanwhile, Venezuela's defense minister, on Sunday, reportedly rejected any notion that the US would \"run\" his country.\n\nThe White House said it believed that Venezuela's government, under the interim leader Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, would fall in line and largely comply with its demands after the capture of Maduro.\n\nTrump repeatedly warned that the United States would take fresh actions against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela, saying strikes on land would begin soon.\n\nIn October, Trump said he had authorised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to operate inside Venezuela to curb illegal flow of migrants and drugs from the South American country.\n\nThe weekend strikes arrived on the heels of months of US military buildup in the region.",

      "body": "Maduro is set to make his first appearance in a US courtroom on drug trafficking charges\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Deposed Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is set to make his first appearance in an American courtroom. Maduro and his wife are expected to appear at noon Monday before a judge in New York. He is accused of narco-terrorism and drug trafficking. The Trump administration used the criminal charges to justify capturing Maduro and removing him to U.S. soil. Maduro's lawyers are expected to contest the legality of his arrest, arguing that he is immune from prosecution as a sovereign head of state. Venezuela's new interim president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, has demanded that the U.S. return Maduro, who long denied any involvement in drug trafficking.\n\nMaduro's case will revive a legal debate over immunity for foreign leaders tested in Noriega trial\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- When Nicol\u00e1s Maduro appears in a New York courtroom to face U.S. drug charges, he'll be following a path taken by Panama's Manuel Noriega, another strongman who was toppled by American forces. As was the case with Noriega, lawyers for Maduro are expected to challenge his arrest by claiming sovereign immunity. That's a bedrock principal of international and U.S. law. But legal experts say that argument is unlikely to succeed because the U.S. doesn't recognize Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader. They say courts are likely to allow the prosecution to proceed despite broader constitutional questions about the U.S. military action that led to his capture.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez becomes Venezuela's interim president after Maduro's ouster\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) -- Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who was captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation. Rodr\u00edguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela's oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. She's part of a band of senior officials in Maduro's administration that now appears to control Venezuela, even as President Donald Trump and other officials say they will pressure the government to fall in line with its vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nAfter Maduro, who's next? Trump spurs speculation about his plans for Greenland, Cuba and Colombia\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after the ouster of Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, President Donald Trump is renewing his calls for an American takeover of the Danish territory of Greenland and is threatening Colombia with military action over its drug trade. Meanwhile, his top diplomat on Sunday declared the communist government in Cuba is \"in a lot of trouble.\" The comments from Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio underscore the administration is serious about taking a more expansive U.S. role in the Western Hemisphere. With thinly veiled threats in the aftermath of the Venezuela operation, Trump is rattling hemispheric friends and foes alike, spurring a pointed question around the globe: Who's next?\n\nHundreds march in silence to honor victims of Swiss bar fire that left 40 dead\n\nCRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) -- Hundreds marched in silence to honor victims of the New Year's Eve fire at a bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. The fire left 40 dead and many injured. Mourners attended a Mass on Sunday at Chapelle Saint-Christophe before marching to Le Constellation bar. The crowd stood in silence, some weeping, and then applauded as flowers were placed at a makeshift memorial. By Sunday evening, Swiss authorities had identified all of the 40 fatalities. A criminal investigation of the bar managers is underway. Authorities believe sparkling candles ignited the fire. Swiss President Guy Parmelin announced a national day of mourning for Jan. 9.\n\nRain continues in parts of California reeling from flooding and high tides\n\nCORTE MADERA, Calif. (AP) -- Crews cleared mud from key California highways as forecasters warned that more thunderstorms were on the way after downpours and high tides caused flooding, prompting road closures and rescues of people trapped in cars. Northern counties remained under a flood watch, with up to three inches of rain possible through Monday night in areas that have been drenched off and on since around Christmas. To the south near the San Francisco Bay Area, waters were slowly receding after roadways were flooded during heavy rain that coincided with record-breaking \"King Tides.\" While the tides were waning, lingering thunderstorms on Sunday could cause additional problems throughout low-lying areas.\n\nOfficers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 say their struggles linger, 5 years after the riot\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years after the Capitol riot, some of the police officers who fought off the rioters that day say they're still struggling with what happened. And that's especially the case since Donald Trump was elected to a second term last year and pardoned about 1,500 people who'd been convicted for their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Several police officers who fought the rioters said in Associated Press interviews that the hardest thing to deal with has been that many people are playing down the violence from that day, or they're ignoring it or claiming it didn't happen. That's despite a massive collection of video and photographic evidence documenting the violence.\n\nInternational aid groups grapple with what Israel's ban will mean for their work in Gaza\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Israel has revoked the licenses of more than three dozen humanitarian organizations, and now those groups are grappling with how that will affect aid operations in Gaza. This decision affects groups like Doctors Without Borders and Oxfam, which provide essential services such as medical care and shelter. The ban, effective March 1, prevents these groups from bringing supplies or international staff into Gaza. Israel says the new rules aim to prevent militant infiltration. Aid groups argue the requirements endanger staff and hinder operations. The United Nations and NGOs warn that the remaining licensed organizations cannot meet Gaza's needs, exacerbating the ongoing humanitarian crisis.\n\nGunmen kill at least 30 villagers and abduct others during raid in northern Nigeria\n\nMINNA, Nigeria (AP) -- Gunmen have killed at least 30 villagers and abducted several others in northern Nigeria's Niger state, according to police. The attack occurred Saturday evening when the gunmen stormed Kasuwan-Daji village, opening fire on residents and burning down the local market and houses. Some residents report the death toll could be higher, with people still missing as of Sunday. They also claim security forces have not yet arrived, despite police statements. Such attacks are common in Nigeria, where rogue gangs often target remote communities. The attackers reportedly came from a forest reserve, a known hideout for armed gangs.\n\nFalcons beat Saints 19-17 to hand division title to Panthers. Atlanta fires coach and GM hours later\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Dee Alford's red-zone interception stopped a potential go-ahead drive by New Orleans, and the Atlanta Falcons beat the Saints 19-17 to give the NFC South title to the Carolina Panthers. By closing the season with four consecutive wins, the Falcons finished in a three-way tie with Carolina and Tampa Bay for first place in the NFC South. The Panthers won the tiebreaker between the three 8-9 teams with the best record within the division. The Falcons completed a season sweep of the Saints, who had their four-game winning streak end. Hours after the game ended, the Falcons fired coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot.",

      "body": "He warned of paying 'a very big price'\n\nA new Venezuelan leader is to be sworn in after the capturing and removal of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by US forces.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez is now Venezuela's acting president, being the vice-president at the time of Maduro's exit.\n\nShe is a Maduro loyalist and also served under previous president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nDespite the US sanctioning Rodr\u00edguez as the next president, she has already demanded Maduro's release, describing him as the \"only president\".\n\nHowever, Trump said on Saturday that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been talking to Rodr\u00edguez, who had expressed her willingness to do \"whatever the US asks\".\n\nThis contradicted comments by Rodr\u00edguez which claimed Venezuela would refuse to become \"a colony of an empire\".\n\nIn her first cabinet meeting on Sunday, she said: \"We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of co-operation orientated towards shared development within the framework of international law.\"\n\nTrump has since sent a warning to Rodr\u00edguez saying she could \"pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro\" if she \"doesn't do what's right\".\n\nWhy did Donald Trump attack Venezuela and what will happen next?\n\nWe are only a matter of days into 2026 and things really have picked back up from where we left off in 2025.\n\nWhile tensions have been on the rise for months now between the United States and Venezuela, it wasn't until the early hours of this morning that Donald Trump decided to take decisive action.\n\nThe cause behind the world's supposed most powerful nation attacking a small South American country? - Complex and with a multitude of geopolitical and economic reasons.\n\nHere's everything we know about this previously simmering and now overflowing conflict.\n\nWhen did tensions start?\n\nRelations between the US and Venezuela have not been good for a long time now.\n\nIn 1998 socialist leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was elected as president and started to nationalise industry and oppose US influence in Latin America.\n\nAs we know, historically the US do not like any politics slightly left of right and naturally became wary and cold towards Venezuela.\n\nOf course, the Americans have precedent, notably in the Cold War where they influenced politics in a number of emerging socialist Latin American nations such as Cuba, Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador, etc.\n\nHowever, things worsened in 2002 following a failed coup attempt which Ch\u00e1vez claimed the US had supported.\n\nChavez would die in 2013 with President (potentially until this morning) Nicol\u00e1s Maduro taking over power.\n\nMaduro is also a socialist leader, but also employed authoritarianism, election manipulation, and human rights abuses, leading to the US imposing sanctions on the nation in 2014.\n\nRelations would worsen further in 2019 when the US recognised opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's interim president.\n\nThis was followed by sanctions, notably on Venezuela's large oil industry - we'll be coming back to that magic three letter word.\n\n2025 - The year of the Trump\n\nNow, these tensions were all pretty much based on tit for tat diplomacy until the arrival of FIFA Peace Prize winner Donald Trump!\n\nTrump started taking direct action against Venezuela in the name of 'the war on drugs' - because all definitely worthy causes for attack/invasion need a 'war on' something.\n\nThis led to Trump ordering the US military to carry out attacks on small trafficking boats bringing drugs to the US.\n\nHowever, this was done in a no forgiveness style which has led to around 110 people dead, as per the BBC.\n\nMany of these attacks have also been carried out in international waters.\n\nTrump also believes that Maduro is at the head of such operations, claiming him to be linked with the Cartel of the Suns, a group designated as a terrorist organisation by the US.\n\nWhile Trump has labelled drug trafficking as reasons for righteous hostility, many have pointed out that the vast majority of drugs entering the US still come through Mexico, and not on small boats from Venezuela, while are mostly produced in Colombia.\n\nTrump has also used this hostility to partially ban migration and travel from Venezuela to the US.\n\nThe real reason?\n\nWhile there may be some truth in the war on drugs and migration, one factor looms large over the heads of those backing military action in Venezuela, and its shadow stretches back decades - oil.\n\nMany have been quick to point out that, quite astonishingly, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, even more than Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states.\n\nThe US has already blockaded oil tankers around Venezuela and it is highly likely to be a motivation behind trying to depose Maduro.\n\nVenezuela has been mistreated and abused by government mishandling, corruption and international sanctions.\n\nA nation with more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia should be one of the richest in the world, but it isn't.\n\nIt is likely, whether to the benefit or not of the Venezuelan people, that Trump will look to broker a deal with a new regime in which America will be able to profit off these oil reserves - although this remains purely speculation.",

Now that he's gone, who knows?\"\n\n- Maduro and 'Super Cilita' -\n\nThe image of Maduro handcuffed and blindfolded as US forces transported him to New York to face trial made headlines around the world.\n\nDuring months in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump, who accused him of being a drug trafficker, the 63-year-old former bus driver deflected pressure by dancing to techno music at near-daily rallies, always broadcast live, as he chanted the mantra \"No war, yes peace!\" -- in English.\n\nFrequently underestimated, Maduro managed to eliminate internal resistance and keep the opposition at bay.\n\nMurals, songs and films celebrated him, as did the animated cartoon \"Super Moustache,\" in which he appeared as a superhero, fighting imperialism alongside \"Super Cilita,\" who is based on Flores.\n\nToy figurines of both characters were also produced.\n\nThe military swore absolute loyalty to him, led by Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez.\n\nThough defiant at first and calling for Maduro's return, Venezuela's interim leader Rodriguez called for a \"balanced and respectful relationship\" between the South American country and the United States on Sunday.\n\n\"The top level of government has survival as its absolute priority,\" Antulio Rosales, political scientist and professor at York University in Canada, told AFP.\n\n- The Rodriguez siblings -\n\nRodriguez controlled the economy and the oil industry as vice president while her brother Jorge is the speaker of parliament.\n\nThey are known for their incendiary rhetoric, often mixing belligerence, irony and insults against the \"enemies of the fatherland.\"\n\nBut behind the scenes, they are skilled political operators.\n\nJorge Rodriguez was the chief negotiator with the opposition and the United States, and his sister represented Maduro in various international forums.\n\nExperts also attribute purges within government to them, such as one that sent Tareck El Aissami, a powerful oil minister until 2023, to prison.\n\nRodriguez took over his post shortly afterwards.\n\n- The feared policeman -\n\nDiosdado Cabello meanwhile is widely feared in Venezuela. Under his ministry, some 2,400 people were detained during protests that followed Maduro's disputed re-election in 2024, in a move that cowed the opposition.\n\nCabello is seen as representing the most radical wing of \"Chavismo,\" and some see him at odds with the pragmatism of the Rodriguez pair, though both sides have denied this.\n\nCabello acted as president for a few hours when Chavez was overthrown for two days in 2002.\n\nHe accompanied Chavez in a failed coup attempt in 1992. Today he is number two in the Socialist Party behind Maduro.\n\nThe US courts have now named Cabello among those wanted for trial alongside Maduro.\n\nThey have offered $25 million for his capture.\n\nHaving kept a low profile in the hours after Maduro's capture, he appeared by Rodriguez's side at her first cabinet meeting as acting president on Sunday.\n\njt/pgf/rlp/cb/sla/ane/cms\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9",

      "title": "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez becomes Venezuela's interim president after Maduro's ouster",
      "body": "MEXICO CITY (AP) -- As uncertainty simmers in Venezuela, interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation, and offered \"to collaborate\" with the Trump administration in what could be a seismic shift in relations between the adversary governments.\n\nRodr\u00edguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela's oil-dependent economy and its feared intelligence service, and was next in the presidential line of succession.\n\nShe's part of a band of senior officials in Maduro's administration that now appears to control Venezuela, even as U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials say they will pressure the government to fall in line with its vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela's high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, and the leader was backed by Venezuela's military.\n\nAlly or adversary\n\nRodr\u00edguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and politician has had a lengthy career representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez on the world stage. It's been unclear if the leader would warm up to the Trump administration or follow the same adversarial line as her predecessor.\n\nHer rise to become interim leader of the South American country came as a surprise on Saturday morning, when Trump announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in communication with Rodr\u00edguez and that the Venezuelan leader was \"gracious\" and would work with the American government. Rubio said Rodr\u00edguez was someone the administration could work with, unlike Maduro.\n\nBut in a televised address, Rodr\u00edguez gave no indication that she would cooperate with Trump, referring to his government as \"extremists\" and maintaining that Maduro was Venezuela's rightful leader.\n\n\"What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\" Rodr\u00edguez said, surrounded by high-ranking civilian officials and military leaders.\n\nTrump warned on Sunday, if Rodr\u00edguez didn't fall in line, \"she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\" He added that he wanted her to provide \"total access,\" from oil facilities to basic infrastructure like roads, so they can be rebuilt.\n\nTrump's comments also followed Rubio having asserted in TV interviews on Sunday that he didn't see Rodr\u00edguez and her government as \"legitimate\" because he said the country never held free and fair elections.\n\nOn Sunday, in statements posted to her Instagram, she took a major shift in tone in a conciliatory message where she said she hoped to build \"respectful relations\" with Trump.\n\n\"We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\" she wrote.\n\nRise to interim president\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, the interim president and her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who was arrested for his involvement in the kidnapping of American business owner William Niehous in 1976, and later died in police custody.\n\nJump start your day.\n\nHeadlines, puzzles and death notices from the Valley delivered to your inbox 7 a.m. daily.\n\nSign Up\n\nUnlike many in Maduro's inner circle, the Rodr\u00edguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S., though the interim president did face U.S. sanctions during Trump's first term for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nRodr\u00edguez held a number of lower-level positions under Ch\u00e1vez's government, but gained prominence working under Maduro to the point of being seen as his successor. She served the economic minister, foreign affairs minister, petroleum minister and others help stabilize Venezuela's endemically crisis-stricken economy after years of rampant inflation and turmoil.\n\nRodr\u00edguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. The interim president also presided over an assembly promoted by Maduro in response to street protests in 2017 meant to neutralize the opposition-majority legislature.\n\nShe enjoys a close relationship with the military, which has long acted as the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, said Ronal Rodr\u00edguez, a spokesperson for the Venezuela Observatory of Rosario University in Bogota, Colombia.\n\n\"She has a very particular relationship with power,\" he said. \"She has developed very strong ties with elements of the armed forces and has managed to establish lines of dialogue with them, largely on a transactional basis.\"\n\nFuture in power\n\nIt's unclear how long Rodr\u00edguez will hold power, or how closely she will work with the Trump administration.\n\nGeoff Ramsey, a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute, said Rodr\u00edguez's initially firm tone with the Trump administration may have been an attempt to \"save face.\" Others have noted that Maduro's capture required some level of collaboration within the Venezuelan government.\n\n\"She can't exactly expect to score points with her revolutionary peers if she presents herself as a patsy for U.S. interests,\" Ramsey said.\n\nVenezuela's constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes \"permanently unavailable\" to serve. Reasons listed include death, resignation, removal from office or \"abandonment\" of duties as declared by the National Assembly.\n\nThat electoral timeline was rigorously followed when Maduro's predecessor, Chavez, died of cancer in 2013. However, the loyalist Supreme Court, in its decision Saturday, cited another provision of the charter in declaring Maduro's absence a \"temporary\" one.\n\nIn such a scenario, there is no election requirement. Instead, the vice president, an unelected position, takes over for up to 90 days -- a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nIn handing temporary power to Rodr\u00edguez, the Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day time limit, leading some to speculate she could try to remain in power even longer as she seeks to unite the disparate factions of the ruling socialist party while shielding it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.\n\n-- -- Janetsky reported from Mexico City and Debre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

      "title": "Rodr\u00edguez Proposes U.S. Cooperation After Maduro's Ouster",
      "body": "U.S.-Backed Leftist Rodr\u00edguez Faces Opposition in Venezuela Transition\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro, the President of Venezuela, was ousted by the United States on the 3rd (local time), and according to the local constitution, Vice President Delsi Rodr\u00edguez succeeded him. Vice President Rodr\u00edguez, also serving as acting president, is a politician from a deeply rooted leftist family and has been one of President Maduro's closest aides.\n\nOn the 4th (local time), Acting President Rodr\u00edguez posted on Instagram, \"Venezuela reaffirms its commitment to peace and peaceful coexistence,\" and proposed to the U.S. government, \"Let us jointly promote a cooperative agenda aimed at mutual development within the framework of international law.\" Earlier, she had strongly opposed the U.S., stating, \"Venezuela will never become a colony of any country, and the only president of Venezuela is Maduro,\" but she changed her stance within less than a day under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who warned, \"If you don't do the right thing, you will pay a price greater than Maduro.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56 years old, is a politician with a legal background. Current and former officials and a source from the U.S. government have evaluated her as a \"ruthless and calculating political operator.\" She is the daughter of Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, an anti-establishment figure who led leftist revolutionary movements. Jorge was arrested after masterminding the kidnapping of William Niehaus, an executive of a U.S. company, and died in custody.\n\nBefore entering politics, Rodr\u00edguez served as a professor at the Central University of Venezuela and as the head of the Venezuelan Labor Lawyers Association. She then began her political career in 2003 under the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez administration. Under the Maduro administration, which succeeded Ch\u00e1vez, she continued her rapid rise to power, reportedly serving as the minister of information and communication technology, foreign affairs, and finance over 10 years, ultimately reaching the pinnacle of power as vice president. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Rodr\u00edguez has been known for her extravagant lifestyle, frequently wearing luxury shoes and carrying designer bags.\n\nHer older brother, Jorge Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez, is also one of Maduro's closest aides and is evaluated to have significantly contributed to his sister's political success. A psychiatrist by training, he served as Venezuela's vice president for one year from 2007 and has been the speaker of the National Assembly since 2021, earning Maduro's full trust. The presidential election last year, which sparked controversy over alleged fraud and led to Maduro's re-election, was also reportedly executed under Jorge's leadership.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Isa, a Venezuelan politician formerly serving as information minister and currently in exile, evaluated the siblings, stating, \"They are extremely calculating and will use every means possible to remain in power for as long as possible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as President Trump signaled a transfer of power to Acting President Rodr\u00edguez, Venezuela's opposition has been cornered, according to evaluations. This is because the U.S., announcing cooperation with Vice President Rodr\u00edguez to operate Venezuela until stabilization, has left those who expressed intentions to succeed to power with no place to stand.\n\nEarlier, on the day of the invasion, President Trump expressed distrust toward Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, stating, \"She is a great person, but she lacks domestic support,\" and \"She cannot be elected without my support.\"",

      "body": "Nicolas Maduro kept a tight grip on power along with his wife and other powerful allies\n\nThe ousting of Nicolas Maduro as Venezuela's president puts to the test his \"Chavista\" factions that have governed the oil-rich nation for 27 years.\n\nWhat happens to the so-called \"club of five\" powerful leftist figures, now that two of its most important members -- Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores -- have been captured and sent to the United States to face trial?\n\n- 'Club of five' -\n\nAnointed by his mentor Hugo Chavez before the latter's death in 2013, Maduro kept a tight grip on power until his capture by US forces on Saturday.\n\nMaduro ruled alongside Flores and three other powerful figures: former vice president Delcy Rodriguez -- now Venezuela's interim leader -- her brother Jorge, and their rival: hardline Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.\n\n\"It's like a club of five,\" a diplomatic source in Caracas told AFP under the condition of anonymity.\n\n\"They can speak, they have a voice in the government, but Maduro was the one who kept the balance. Now that he's gone, who knows?\"\n\n- Maduro and 'Super Cilita' -\n\nThe image of Maduro handcuffed and blindfolded as US forces transported him to New York to face trial made headlines around the world.\n\nDuring months in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump, who accused him of being a drug trafficker, the 63-year-old former bus driver deflected pressure by dancing to techno music at near-daily rallies, always broadcast live, as he chanted the mantra \"No war, yes peace!\" -- in English.\n\nFrequently underestimated, Maduro managed to eliminate internal resistance and keep the opposition at bay.\n\nMaduro and his wife Cilia Flores promoted a cult of personality\n\nMurals, songs and films celebrated him, as did the animated cartoon \"Super Moustache,\" in which he appeared as a superhero, fighting imperialism alongside \"Super Cilita,\" who is based on Flores.\n\nToy figurines of both characters were also produced.\n\nThe military swore absolute loyalty to him, led by Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez.\n\nThough defiant at first and calling for Maduro's return, Venezuela's interim leader Rodriguez called for a \"balanced and respectful relationship\" between the South American country and the United States on Sunday.\n\n\"The top level of government has survival as its absolute priority,\" Antulio Rosales, political scientist and professor at York University in Canada, told AFP.\n\n- The Rodriguez siblings -\n\nRodriguez controlled the economy and the oil industry as vice president while her brother Jorge is the speaker of parliament.\n\nThey are known for their incendiary rhetoric, often mixing belligerence, irony and insults against the \"enemies of the fatherland.\"\n\nBut behind the scenes, they are skilled political operators.\n\nDelcy Rodriguez was vice-president and her brother Jorge president of parliament among other roles\n\nJorge Rodriguez was the chief negotiator with the opposition and the United States, and his sister represented Maduro in various international forums.\n\nExperts also attribute purges within government to them, such as one that sent Tareck El Aissami, a powerful oil minister until 2023, to prison.\n\nRodriguez took over his post shortly afterwards.\n\n- The feared policeman -\n\nDiosdado Cabello meanwhile is widely feared in Venezuela. Under his ministry, some 2,400 people were detained during protests that followed Maduro's disputed re-election in 2024, in a move that cowed the opposition.\n\nCabello is seen as representing the most radical wing of \"Chavismo,\" and some see him at odds with the pragmatism of the Rodriguez pair, though both sides have denied this.\n\nDiosdado Cabello was Maduro's feared interior minister\n\nCabello acted as president for a few hours when Chavez was overthrown for two days in 2002.\n\nHe accompanied Chavez in a failed coup attempt in 1992. Today he is number two in the Socialist Party behind Maduro.\n\nThe US courts have now named Cabello among those wanted for trial alongside Maduro.\n\nThey have offered $25 million for his capture.\n\nHaving kept a low profile in the hours after Maduro's capture, he appeared by Rodriguez's side at her first cabinet meeting as acting president on Sunday.",

      "body": "Interim President Delcy Rodriguez has said she is willing to cooperate with the United States on the future of Venezuela, in a significant shift in tone from the immediate aftermath of a military operation leading to the abduction of leader Nicolas Maduro by US special forces.\n\n\"We consider it a priority to move towards a balanced and respectful relationship between the US and Venezuela,\" Rodriguez wrote on Telegram on Sunday.\n\n\"We extend an invitation to the US government to work together on an agenda for cooperation that is aimed towards shared development,\" she continued.\n\nRodriguez, who served as Maduro's deputy since 2018, was made interim leader by Venezuela's Supreme Court on Saturday after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained in the most high-profile and riskiest US military operation since the US Navy's SEAL team killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in a safe house in Pakistan's Abbottabad in 2011.\n\nIn a televised address on Saturday, Rodriguez denounced the US actions as \"an atrocity that violates international law\", insisting that \"the only president of Venezuela [is] President Nicolas Maduro.\"\n\nRodriguez's televised remarks created a rift with Trump, who had suggested in the immediate aftermath of Maduro's capture that US officials were in communication with her, and she was willing to cooperate.\n\nAfter Rodriguez called his administration a group of \"extremists\" on television, Trump quickly shifted his tone from calling Rodriguez \"gracious\" to threatening her directly.\n\n\"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,\" Trump told The Atlantic magazine in an interview early on Sunday.\n\nThe US president also said further strikes on Venezuela could take place, and he would not rule out putting \"boots on the ground\" in Venezuela, reiterating that the US was now \"in charge\".\n\nThe belligerent actions and stance, which have prompted protests in the US and around the world, fly in the face of Trump's election \"America First\" stance and keeping the country out of endless wars, as well as his previous criticism of regime change in the Iraq War.\n\nRodriguez separately said on Sunday that she had launched a commission to seek the release of Maduro and Flores from US detention, where the Venezuelan leader is facing charges of \"narcoterrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machineguns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices\".\n\nThe commission will be cochaired by Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil and her brother Jorge, who is president of Venezuela's National Assembly.\n\nMaduro may face a similar future as Panamanian President Manuel Noriega, who was taken by US forces in 1990 after hiding out in his country's Vatican embassy in the aftermath of the US invasion of Panama.\n\nNoriega, formerly a staunch US ally, also faced similar charges of \"racketeering, drug smuggling, and money laundering\" and was sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. His sentence was commuted to 17 years for good behaviour, but he was later extradited to France on separate charges, then back to Panama, where he served out more prison time until he died in 2017.\n\nMaduro is due to appear in a New York federal court on Monday.\n\nTrump administration officials have portrayed the seizure as a law enforcement action to hold Maduro accountable for criminal charges filed in 2020 that accuse him of narco-terrorism conspiracy.\n\nBut Trump has said other factors were at play, saying the raid was prompted in part by an influx of Venezuelan immigrants to the US and the country's decision to nationalise US oil interests decades ago.",

      "title": "Venezuelan journalist Braz\u00f3n: Citizens are happy about Maduro's capture, but they can't celebrate",
      "body": "Amid dramatic claims surrounding the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by U.S. forces, uncertainty continues to grip Venezuela. While Washington has made bold statements about its role in the country's future, power dynamics on the ground appear far more complex, with the Chavista apparatus still firmly in control.\n\nTo understand what is unfolding beyond official statements and breaking news headlines, Onlinekhabar spoke with Ana Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez Braz\u00f3n, a senior Venezuelan journalist who has long covered conflict, politics, and religion in Latin America. Currently a correspondent for Colombia's leading daily El Tiempo, Rodr\u00edguez Braz\u00f3n offers a ground-level view of how ordinary Venezuelans are responding to the crisis, the state of repression inside the country, and the political scenarios that may emerge in the days ahead.\n\nIn this interview, she explains the current status of Venezuela.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the current situation on the ground in Caracas and other major Venezuelan cities following the U.S. strike?\n\nThe streets have remained virtually deserted due to fears that the repressive apparatus will imprison or kill citizens. People have formed long queues at supermarkets and pharmacies to buy essential products.\n\nHow has the Venezuelan government apparatus responded after President Maduro's capture, and how are the country's military forces and security agencies reacting to the resulting leadership vacuum?\n\nPolice forces, commanded by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, remain deployed across the streets, monitoring citizens to prevent protests against the regime.\n\nThe Supreme Court has named Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez as interim president. However, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that the United States will \"run\" Venezuela. Who appears to be in control at this moment?\n\nAt this moment, without a doubt, Chavismo continues to control the country. It is unclear what President Trump's statement is based on or what its actual implications are.\n\nReports indicate that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife have landed in New York and may be taken to a U.S. detention centre. How serious are the drug and weapons charges the US is planning to file against Maduro?\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro faces charges of terrorism and drug trafficking, in addition to being considered a dictator. Since 2020, the United States has offered a $50 million reward for his capture. It should also be noted that Maduro is under investigation by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity committed in Venezuela.\n\nInternational media suggest mixed reactions among the Venezuelan population. How are Venezuelan citizens reacting to the news of his capture?\n\nCitizens are happy about Maduro's capture, but they cannot celebrate. It is important to remember that Chavismo still controls power and the repressive apparatus. More than 900 political prisoners remain detained, many of them tortured and held incommunicado. Several are imprisoned in El Helicoide, which is often compared to Sednaya prison in Syria. Under these conditions, no one is going to take to the streets to celebrate.\n\nHow are ordinary Venezuelans interpreting the U.S. intervention? Do they view it as an occupation, a liberation, or something else?\n\nThey do not see it as an intervention, but rather as a successful yet incomplete operation, because Chavismo remains in power. What Venezuelans want is for opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez to take office as president-elect, having won more than seven million votes. Gonz\u00e1lez is currently in exile due to persecution by the regime.\n\nIn your opinion, what key events or provocations might have triggered this U.S. military action?\n\nThere are several reasons. The United States had offered a reward for Maduro's capture. It also participated in several dialogue processes between Chavismo and the opposition, which Maduro repeatedly failed to honour. Additionally, during President Trump's first administration, the White House had already attempted to overthrow Maduro.\n\nSome Venezuelans believe that President Trump's actions are not about restoring democracy but about exploiting Venezuela's oil resources. What political or economic motivations might lie behind such a large-scale U.S. operation?\n\nObviously, the United States has oil interests. In fact, it contributed significantly to the consolidation of Venezuela's oil industry after the first well was drilled in 1920. However, to claim that oil is the sole objective is to ignore the fact that Cuba has taken Venezuelan oil for years without payment. Several Caribbean nations also benefited from Venezuelan oil for a long time without oversight. Russia, China, and Iran have similarly taken advantage of Venezuela's resources and strategic geographic location. Therefore, this narrative is largely a Chavista argument against the United States.\n\nWhich international reactions have stood out most to you, and how might they shape the next phase of developments in Venezuela?\n\nSo far, the reactions have mainly come from the regime's traditional allies and accomplices, Nicaragua and Cuba.\n\nWhat has been the immediate humanitarian impact of these events, particularly regarding food supply, healthcare, and infrastructure?\n\nThere has been no immediate humanitarian impact. The country has not come to a halt. People are lining up at supermarkets mainly as a preventive measure to stock up on supplies.\n\nFrom your perspective, what are the possible scenarios for Venezuela's political future in the coming weeks and in the longer term?\n\nIt is still too early to conclude. Many scenarios are possible. For now, it appears that the United States is proposing that Delcy Rodr\u00edguez maintain order while preparations are made for an orderly transition to democracy. Maduro stole the July 28, 2024, elections, which is widely acknowledged. A peaceful transition is the best possible outcome for the country.",

      "title": "Venezuelans wonder who's in charge as Trump claims contact with Maduro's deputy",
      "body": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Uncertainty gripped Venezuela on Saturday as people scrambled to understand who was in charge of the South American country after a U.S. military operation captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\n\"What will happen tomorrow? What will happen in the next hour? Nobody knows,\" Caracas resident Juan Pablo Petrone said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered a shocking pick for who would take control: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro's most trusted aides.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez has served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela's oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n\"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" Trump told reporters of Rodr\u00edguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump's first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nLong lines wound through supermarkets and outside gas stations as Venezuelans long used to crises stocked up once again. Small pro-government rallies broke out in parts of Caracas, but most streets remained empty in the nation of 29 million people.\n\nIn a major snub, Trump said opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded last year's Nobel Peace Prize, didn't have the support to run the country.\n\nTrump said Rodr\u00edguez had a long conversation with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in which Trump claimed she said, \"'We'll do whatever you need.'\"\n\n\"I think she was quite gracious,\" Trump added. \"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez tried to project strength and unity among the ruling party's many factions, downplaying any hint of betrayal. In remarks on state TV, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and denounced the U.S. operation as a flagrant violation of the United Nations charter.\n\n\"There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\" Rodr\u00edguez said, surrounded by top civilian officials and military commanders.\n\nThere was no immediate sign that the U.S. was running Venezuela.\n\nNo sign of a swearing-in\n\nTrump indicated that Rodr\u00edguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodr\u00edguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n\"What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\" she said. \"History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan constitution also says a new election must be called within a month in the event of the president's absence. But experts have been debating whether the succession scenario would apply here, given the government's lack of popular legitimacy and the extraordinary U.S. military intervention.\n\nVenezuelan military officials were quick to project defiance in video messages.\n\n\"They have attacked us but will not break us,\" said Defense Minister Gen. Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, dressed in fatigues.\n\nInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared on state TV in a helmet and flak jacket, urging Venezuelans to \"trust in the political leadership and military\" and \"get out on the streets\" to defend the country's sovereignty.\n\n\"These rats attacked and they will regret what they did,\" he said of the U.S.\n\nJump start your day.\n\nHeadlines, puzzles and death notices from the Valley delivered to your inbox 7 a.m. daily.\n\nSign Up\n\nCaracas residents like Yanire Lucas were left picking up shattered glass and other debris after an early-morning explosion in a military base next to her house.\n\n\"What is happening is unprecedented,\" Lucas said, adding that her family is scared to leave home. \"We're still on edge, and now we're uncertain about what to do.\"\n\nStrong ties with Wall Street\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodr\u00edguez has a long history of representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez on the world stage.\n\nShe and her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have strong leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who died in police custody in the 1970s, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro's inner circle, the Rodr\u00edguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S. Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change.\n\nAmong her past interlocutors was Blackwater founder Erik Prince and, more recently, Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy who tried to negotiate a deal with Maduro for greater U.S. influence in Venezuela.\n\nFluent in English, Rodr\u00edguez is sometimes portrayed as a well-educated moderate in contrast to the military hardliners who took up arms with Ch\u00e1vez against Venezuela's democratically elected president in the 1990s.\n\nMany of them, especially Cabello, are wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges and stand accused of serious human rights abuses. But they continue to hold sway over the armed forces, the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela.\n\nThat presents major challenges to Rodr\u00edguez asserting authority. But experts say that Venezuela's power brokers have long had a habit of closing ranks behind their leaders.\n\n\"These leaders have all seen the value of staying united. Cabello has always taken a second seat or third seat, knowing that his fate is tied up with Maduro's, and now he very well might do that again,\" said David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has conducted research into Venezuela's political dynamics over the past three decades.\n\n\"A lot depends on what happened last night, which officials were taken out, what the state of the military looks like now,\" Smilde said. \"If it doesn't have much firepower anymore, they're more vulnerable and diminished and it will be easier for her to gain control.\"\n\nAn apparent snub of the opposition\n\nShortly before Trump's press conference, Machado, the opposition leader, called on her ally Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez -- a retired diplomat widely considered to have won the country's disputed 2024 presidential election -- to \"immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nIn an triumphant statement, Machado promised that her movement would \"restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional country and bring our children back home.\"\n\nShe added: \"Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and take power.\"\n\nAsked about Machado, Trump was blunt: \"I think it would be very tough for (Machado) to be the leader,\" he said.\n\n\"She doesn't have the support or respect within the country.\"\n\nVenezuelans expressed shock, with many speculating on social media that Trump had mixed up the two women's names. Machado has not responded to Trump's remarks.\n\nGoodman reported from Miami. Associated Press journalist Juan Arraez in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.",

      "body": "President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as head of Venezuela following the capture of socialist dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by U.S. forces earlier that day.\n\n\"I understand she was just sworn in, but she was, as you know, picked by Maduro. Marco [Rubio] is working on that directly. He just had a conversation with her, and she's essentially willing to do what we think its necessary to Make Venezuela great again, very simple,\" President Trump told reporters.\n\nAt another part of the press conference, President Trump said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth will be a \"team\" that will work with the people of Venezuela to make sure that \"we have Venezuela right.\"\n\n\"Because for us to just leave, who's gonna take over? I mean, there's nobody to take over. You have a Vice President who's been appointed by Maduro, and right now she is the Vice President and she is, I guess, the President, she was sworn as President just a little while ago,\" President Trump said. \"She had a long conversation with Marco and she said, 'We'll do whatever you need.' I think she was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018 and as oil minister since 2024 in addition to having occupied several other high-ranking positions at the Maduro regime throughout the past two decades. Her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, presently serves as head of the socialist-controlled National Assembly, with the brother-and-sister-group representing one of the most powerful alliances of the regime's civilian wing. The Venezuelan vice presidency is not a democratically elected position and can be freely appointed and removed by the president as per the nation's constitution.\n\nRodr\u00edguez's whereabouts remain publicly uncertain at press time. Reuters, citing \"four sources familiar with her movements,\" said that the Venezuelan Vice President was in Russia -- but noted that the Russian Foreign Ministry \"dismissed the report about Rodriguez's presence in their country as 'fake.'\"\n\nOn Saturday morning, Rodr\u00edguez spoke to VTV, the Venezuelan regime's flagship news channel, and asserted that the Venezuelan regime had no information on Maduro's whereabouts after he and his wife Cilia Flores were captured by U.S. forces earlier that day. Rodr\u00edguez demanded that the U.S. government immediately shows \"proof of life\" of Maduro and Flores.\n\nIn 2018, during President Trump's first term, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, her brother Jorge, the now-captured Cilia Flores, and other members of the Maduro regime. Similarly, the European Union imposed sanctions on Delcy Rodr\u00edguez in 2018.",

According to President Donald Trump, Maduro was seized in a late night military operation and transferred to a US naval vessel to be transported to New York to face charges related to drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. The operation reportedly included large-scale military strikes, marking the most direct intervention to date.\n\nWhile Maduro is now out of power, the political future of Venezuela remains uncertain. Trump said the United States would effectively be \"running\" the country for the foreseeable future, though he offered few details on what that would entail. Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, has been sworn in, and US officials have suggested a willingness to work with existing regime figures, even as Rodr\u00edguez publicly rejected any notion of US control and called for Maduro's return. As details of the operation continue to emerge, major questions remain. Follow along here for the latest updates and analysis.",

She also highlighted the outrage among the Venezuelan populace over what she termed the \"illegal and illegitimate abduction\" of both Maduro and Flores, emphasizing that \"all of Venezuela\" had been mobilized in response.\n\nAs part of the official response, Rodr\u00edguez mentioned that the National Defense Council had been activated, alongside a decree of \"external commotion\" reportedly signed by President Maduro. This decree was set to be delivered to the president of the Supreme Court for constitutional backing in its Constitutional Chamber. She noted that actions outlined in the decree would begin \"immediately\" pending this support.\n\nOn the political front, Rodr\u00edguez asserted that the country \"will not become a colony\" and denounced the events as \"barbaric,\" claiming they violated international law. She affirmed the government's readiness to defend Venezuela and its \"natural resources,\" especially focusing on \"hydrocarbons\" and \"energy resources.\"\n\nIn the latter part of her speech, Rodr\u00edguez outlined conditions for any future discussions. \"We are open to relations of respect... within the framework of international legality and the laws of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\" she stated, adding that this would be the only acceptable framework for interactions post what she described as an attack and military aggression against the nation and Caracas.\n\nHer remarks followed President Trump's assertion that his team had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez, who he claimed had expressed willingness to engage with Washington. However, the transcript provided no further specifics on this communication.\n\nPresident Trump declared that his government would oversee Venezuela and its oil revenues following Maduro's capture, with Delcy Rodr\u00edguez leading a transitional government under terms set by Washington. From his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump emphasized that the United States would take control of the country \"until a fair democratic transition\" occurs, citing the Venezuelan infrastructure as \"rotten\" and promising that the oil would be managed to benefit both the Venezuelan people and compensate the U.S. for previous expropriations.\n\n\"We are going to run this country properly and ensure the Venezuelan people are taken care of,\" Trump stated, not ruling out future military actions should Chavista factions attempt to regain control. Notably, he mentioned that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in dialogue with Rodr\u00edguez, whom he described as willing \"to do what we believe needs to be done to make Venezuela great again,\" echoing his own campaign slogan.\n\nTrump suggested that Rodr\u00edguez would assume leadership of a transitional government, while the U.S. would secure and manage strategic resources, particularly oil. \"We'll make a lot of money to take care of the country,\" he added, without specifying timelines or mechanisms.",

      "body": "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, Venezuela's new interim leader, arrives at the job with impeccable leftist credentials.\n\nShe is the daughter of a Marxist guerrilla who won fame for kidnapping an American businessman, was educated partly in France, where she specialized in labor law and rose to meteoric heights in the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom she is succeeding.\n\nBut Ms. Rodr\u00edguez, 56, is also known for building bridges with Venezuela's economic elites, foreign investors and diplomats, presenting herself as a cosmopolitan technocrat in a militaristic and male-dominated government.\n\nAfter Venezuela's economy endured a harrowing crash from 2013 to 2021, she spearheaded a market-friendly overhaul which had provided a semblance of economic stability before the U.S. military campaign targeting Mr. Maduro.\n\nHer privatization of state assets and relatively conservative fiscal policy had left Venezuela somewhat better prepared to resist the Trump administration's blockade of sanctioned tankers carrying oil, the country's economic lifeblood.\n\nThe contradictions enveloping Ms. Rodr\u00edguez were on display on Saturday when she addressed the nation on state television. While President Trump said that Ms. Rodr\u00edguez had been sworn in as Venezuela's new president, it was clear that Mr. Maduro's supporters -- including her -- still see him as Venezuela's legitimate leader.\n\nMs. Rodr\u00edguez repeatedly said that Mr. Maduro was Venezuela's \"only president,\" and even the text on Venezuelan state television labeled her as vice president. When she ended, the state broadcaster immediately said that Ms. Rodr\u00edguez, as the vice president, had just made clear that Mr. Maduro remained Venezuela's president.\n\nMs. Rodr\u00edguez rose to prominence after Mr. Maduro became president in 2013, following the death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the founder of Venezuela's Bolivarian political movement, which blends left-wing and nationalist ideals.\n\nMr. Maduro appointed her as communications minister, before naming her foreign affairs minister, the first woman to hold that post in Venezuela.\n\nShuttling between Latin American capitals, she often seemed to revel in feuding with conservative leaders.\n\nIn 2018, Ms. Rodr\u00edguez was promoted again, this time to the vice presidency, and the head of SEBIN, a Venezuelan intelligence agency. She took on additional duties in 2020 as economy minister and proceeded to extend an olive branch to business elites in Venezuela.\n\nBut she has also been targeted by sanctions from the United States, Canada and the European Union for her role in supporting and helping to oversee crackdowns on dissent in Venezuela.\n\nHer entry into Venezuelan politics seemed natural as the daughter of Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a Marxist leader who led the kidnapping in Venezuela of William Niehous, an American businessman who was held for three years in a jungle hide-out and rescued in 1979.\n\nHer father was arrested and charged for his role in the kidnapping and died in 1976, at the age of 34, after being interrogated by intelligence agents.\n\nPolitics and leftist activism run in the family. Ms. Rodr\u00edguez's older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, is another member of Mr. Maduro's inner circle. He is the president of the National Assembly and was Mr. Maduro's chief political strategist.\n\nAnatoly Kurmanaev contributed reporting from Venezuela.\n\nSimon Romero is a Times correspondent covering Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.

      "title": "Venezuelans wonder who's in charge as Trump claims contact with...",
      "body": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - Venezuelans on Saturday were scrambling to understand who is in charge of their country after a U.S. military operation that captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered a shocking pick: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro's most trusted aides.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez has served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela's oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n\"She\u00b4s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" Trump told reporters of Rodr\u00edguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump\u00b4s first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nIn a major snub, Trump said opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded last year's Nobel Peace Prize, didn't have the support to run the country.\n\nTrump said Rodr\u00edguez had a long conversation with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in which Trump claimed she said, \"'We\u00b4ll do whatever you need.\u00b4\"\n\nA supporter of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro stands on a median strip waving a national flag in Caracas, Venezuela, Saturday, Jan. 3, 2026, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Maduro had been captured and flown out of the country. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos)\n\n\"I think she was quite gracious,\" Trump added. \"We can\u00b4t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn\u00b4t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez tried to project strength and unity among the ruling party's many factions, downplaying any hint of betrayal. In remarks on state TV, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and denounced the U.S. operation as a flagrant violation of the United Nations charter.\n\n\"There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\" Rodr\u00edguez said, surrounded by top civilian officials and military commanders.\n\nThere was no immediate sign that the U.S. was running Venezuela.\n\n\"What will happen tomorrow? What will happen in the next hour? Nobody knows,\" Caracas resident Juan Pablo Petrone said.\n\nTrump indicated that Rodr\u00edguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodr\u00edguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n\"What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\" she said. \"History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan constitution also says a new election must be called within a month in the event of the president\u00b4s absence.\n\nBut experts have been debating whether the succession scenario would apply here, given the government\u00b4s lack of popular legitimacy and the extraordinary U.S. military intervention.\n\nVenezuelan military officials were quick to project defiance in video messages.\n\n\"They have attacked us but will not break us,\" said Defense Minister Gen. Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, dressed in fatigues.\n\nInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared on state TV in a helmet and flak jacket, urging Venezuelans to \"trust in the political leadership and military\" and \"get out on the streets\" to defend the country\u00b4s sovereignty.\n\n\"These rats attacked and they will regret what they did,\" he said of the U.S.\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodr\u00edguez has a long history of representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez on the world stage.\n\nShe and her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have strong leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who died in police custody in the 1970s, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro\u00b4s inner circle, the Rodr\u00edguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S. Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change.\n\nAmong her past interlocutors was Blackwater founder Erik Prince and, more recently, Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy who tried to negotiate a deal with Maduro for greater U.S. influence in Venezuela.\n\nFluent in English, Rodr\u00edguez is sometimes portrayed as a well-educated moderate in contrast to the military hardliners who took up arms with Ch\u00e1vez against Venezuela's democratically elected president in the 1990s.\n\nMany of them, especially Cabello, are wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges and stand accused of serious human rights abuses. But they continue to hold sway over the armed forces, the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela.\n\nThat presents major challenges to Rodr\u00edguez asserting authority. But experts say that Venezuela\u00b4s power brokers have long had a habit of closing ranks behind their leaders.\n\n\"These leaders have all seen the value of staying united. Cabello has always taken a second seat or third seat, knowing that his fate is tied up with Maduro\u00b4s, and now he very well might do that again,\" said David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has conducted research into Venezuela's political dynamics over the past three decades.\n\n\"A lot depends on what happened last night, which officials were taken out, what the state of the military looks like now,\" Smilde said. \"If it doesn\u00b4t have much firepower anymore, they\u00b4re more vulnerable and diminished and it will be easier for her to gain control.\"\n\nShortly before Trump's press conference, Machado, the opposition leader, called on her ally Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez - a retired diplomat widely considered to have won the country\u00b4s disputed 2024 presidential election - to \"immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nIn an triumphant statement, Machado promised that her movement would \"restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional country and bring our children back home.\"\n\nShe added: \"Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and take power.\"\n\nAsked about Machado, Trump was blunt: \"I think it would be very tough for (Machado) to be the leader,\" he said.\n\n\"She doesn\u00b4t have the support or respect within the country.\"\n\nVenezuelans expressed shock, with many speculating on social media that Trump had mixed up the two women's names. Machado has not responded to Trump's remarks.\n\n___\n\nGoodman reported from Miami.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President and Oil Minister Delcy Rodriguez gives a press conference at the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas, Venezuela, March 10, 2025.

She emphasized that political, military, and security bodies were functioning at peak readiness throughout the nation.\n\nRodr\u00edguez also noted that Venezuelans had already responded to a previous call for mobilization, with grassroots organizations taking to the streets and the armed forces and security agencies deployed nationwide.\n\nShe presented the actions as necessary to protect the nation's sovereignty and independence.\n\nThe vice president characterized the events as a significant violation of the United Nations Charter, pointing to breaches of its fundamental tenets. She labeled the situation as an act of foreign aggression, which had sparked international alarm.\n\nShe also noted that numerous countries, including China and Russia, along with nations across Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia, had voiced their support for Venezuela.\n\nDrawing on the legacy of independence leader Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Rodr\u00edguez declared that Venezuela would not yield to foreign control, calling for unity among the military, police, and the populace.\n\nShe urged citizens to stay composed and united in the face of threats to the nation's sovereignty.\n\nRodr\u00edguez stated that the government is still willing to engage in dialogue and maintain relationships built on mutual respect and adherence to international law. However, she condemned the reported detention of Maduro and his wife as a \"illegal kidnapping,\" executed during military operations.\n\nShe declared that the National Defense Council would continue to meet regularly, anticipating judicial approval for an emergency decree signed by Maduro. This decree would empower the government to enact further measures within constitutional guidelines.\n\nRodr\u00edguez also took aim at international sanctions imposed on Venezuela, arguing they infringe upon human rights and constitute crimes against humanity. She emphasized the country's resilience in the face of economic hardship and reiterated Venezuela's dedication to preserving peace, independence, and its political future through national unity, not violence.",

She told citizens that the attack on Venezuela was \"barbarity\" and demanded the U.S. release Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.\n\n\"We had already warned that an aggression was underway under false excuses and false pretenses, and that the masks had fallen off, revealing only one objective: regime change in Venezuela,\" she said, according to The New York Times. \"This regime change would also allow for the seizure of our energy, mineral and natural resources. This is the true objective, and the world and the international community must know it.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez added that she is willing to talk and \"have respectful relations\" with the Trump administration.\n\n\"It is the only thing we will accept for a type of relationship after having attacked [Venezuela],\" Rodr\u00edguez said, according to The Associated Press.\n\nFollowing the attack, Rodr\u00edguez called on the U.S. to show \"proof of life\" of Maduro and Flores. She condemned the attacks and capture as a \"complete brutal aggression against our people.\"\n\nThe U.S. carried out strikes in the capital of Caracas early Saturday morning. The U.S. Army's Delta Force entered Maduro's compound and arrested him and Flores. Both were flown to the aircraft carrier USS Iwo Jima headed for New York, where the two will face charges.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi unsealed Maduro and Flores's indicting charges, which are a superseding indictment on Saturday that builds on charges initially filed against Maduro in 2020.\n\nTrump told reporters from his Mar-a-Lago resort that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela until the country has a peaceful transition of power. He did not say if opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado should take over, claiming that she \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country.\"\n\nMachado praised Maduro's capture and wrote in a letter shared on the social platform X that \"the hour of freedom has arrived!\" She said opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, whom Maduro defeated in Venezuela's elections in 2024 amid allegations of widespread voter fraud, should take over.",

      "title": "Delcy Rodriguez Demands Maduro's Release, Rejects U.S. Control",
      "body": "Venezuela's VP Pushes Back on Trump Claims, Demands Maduro Freed, and Rejects US Control\n\nDelcy Rodriguez Venezuela tensions escalated after the country's vice president went on national television demanding the immediate release of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and rejecting U.S. authority outright. As tensions between Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, Trump, and Venezuela escalate, the Venezuelan vice president went on national television demanding the immediate release of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and declaring that the Venezuelan people will never again be a colony of an empire or slaves to another nation. Her message was direct, defiant, and aimed squarely at the United States.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, who serves as vice president under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, rejected US authority outright while demanding Maduro's immediate release. She said there is only one legitimate president of Venezuela and that foreign governments have no right to remove or detain him.\n\nThe moment carried extra weight because Venezuelan state officials confirmed Rodr\u00edguez had been sworn in to assume executive authority following Maduro's detention, a move the government described as constitutional continuity. Rodr\u00edguez addressed the country as the acting head of state, presenting herself as the legal steward of the presidency until Maduro's return.\n\nThat stance directly clashes with comments made by Donald Trump, who publicly suggested Rodr\u00edguez would comply with US direction and do whatever Washington demanded. Rodr\u00edguez shut that down fast. In her address, she made it clear she answers to the Venezuelan people only and not to the United States, saying her role is to defend national independence, not manage a handoff of power.\n\nShe leaned heavily into history and resistance, reminding viewers that Venezuela's wealth, land, and political future have long been targets of outside control. Her tone wasn't diplomatic. It was defiant. Rodr\u00edguez framed the US actions as an attempt to dominate Venezuela's resources and decision making, and she positioned her leadership as a line in the sand.\n\nThis wasn't just about Maduro. It was about identity. Rodr\u00edguez spoke directly to Venezuelans at home and abroad, calling for unity and calm while insisting the country would not bow to pressure or intimidation. The message was blunt: Venezuela will govern itself, period.",

      "body": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Venezuelans on Saturday were scrambling to understand who is in charge of their country after a U.S. military operation that captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered a shocking pick: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro's most trusted aides.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez has served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela's oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n\"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" Trump told reporters of Rodr\u00edguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump's first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nIn a major snub, Trump said opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded last year's Nobel Peace Prize, didn't have the support to run the country.\n\nTrump said Rodr\u00edguez had a long conversation with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in which Trump claimed she said, \"'We'll do whatever you need.'\"\n\n\"I think she was quite gracious,\" Trump added. \"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez tried to project strength and unity among the ruling party's many factions, downplaying any hint of betrayal. In remarks on state TV, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and denounced the U.S. operation as a flagrant violation of the United Nations charter.\n\n\"There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\" Rodr\u00edguez said, surrounded by top civilian officials and military commanders.\n\nThere was no immediate sign that the U.S. was running Venezuela.\n\n\"What will happen tomorrow? What will happen in the next hour? Nobody knows,\" Caracas resident Juan Pablo Petrone said.\n\nTrump indicated that Rodr\u00edguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodr\u00edguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition.

      "title": "Trump says US will run Venezuela after Maduro capture, but vice president rejects power transfer",
      "body": "\"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump told reporters after announcing the capture of President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on January 3 that Washington would temporarily administer Venezuela following a predawn military operation that ousted President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power, though the country's vice president rejected assuming office and demanded the leader's immediate release.\n\nThe dramatic action, which followed months of secret planning, resulted in Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores being detained at their residence on a military base and transported aboard the USS Iwo Jima to face narco-terrorism charges in New York, according to Trump.\n\nSpeaking at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump announced plans to exploit the leadership vacuum to repair Venezuela's ailing oil infrastructure and sell \"large amounts\" of the country's petroleum reserves to other nations.\n\n\"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump told reporters, describing the operation as a warning to those threatening American sovereignty.\n\nThe US president pointed to Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez as Washington's immediate handpicked successor for Maduro, saying that \"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"\n\nHowever, Rodr\u00edguez appeared on state television a few hours later to reject the US assertion that she had been sworn in as president, declaring Maduro remained Venezuela's sole legitimate leader.\n\n\"There is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros,\" Rodr\u00edguez said, demanding his immediate release.\n\nThe conflicting statements highlighted uncertainty over Venezuela's governance following the operation, which Trump said was conducted under legal authority to stem dangerous drug flows, though lawmakers from both parties questioned the constitutional basis for military action without congressional approval.\n\nOpposition leader sidelined\n\nTrump's plans appeared to sideline opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month for her campaign to restore democracy in Venezuela.\n\nAsked at his news conference whether he had spoken with Machado, Trump replied \"no\" and suggested she lacked sufficient domestic backing to govern Venezuela.\n\n\"She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country\" necessary to lead, Trump said.\n\nThe comments came just hours after Machado declared on social media that \"the hour of freedom has come,\" stating that she and Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez were \"ready to enforce our mandate and take power.\"\n\nMachado had backed Gonz\u00e1lez as the opposition presidential candidate in the 2024 election after regime-aligned authorities barred her from running on trumped-up charges. Opposition-collected voting tallies indicated Gonz\u00e1lez defeated Maduro by a substantial margin, though electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner.\n\nNumerous countries, including the UK, the EU and the United States, recognised Gonz\u00e1lez as the legitimate president-elect. However, Maduro retained support from the military and electoral council and was sworn in for another six-year term.\n\nVenezuela denounces 'illegal kidnapping'\n\nRodr\u00edguez, speaking at an emergency National Defence Council meeting alongside senior government officials, slammed the operation as an \"unprecedented\" military aggression resulting in the \"illegal kidnapping\" of Maduro and Flores.\n\nThe vice president said the true objective was \"regime change in Venezuela\" to enable the United States to \"plunder our energy, mineral, and natural resources,\" calling on the international community to recognise this.\n\nState broadcaster TeleSUR reported Rodr\u00edguez convened the emergency session whilst activating the Citizen Security Agency and national defence apparatus to protect what Venezuela described as its violated independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nRodr\u00edguez noted that Maduro had in a television interview just two days earlier reaffirmed Venezuela's willingness to maintain dialogue with Washington \"to address a constructive agenda\" through diplomatic and political channels based on mutual respect.\n\nShe said the US action \"flagrantly violates Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter of the United Nations,\" despite Venezuela's extended hand to establish relations benefiting both peoples through friendship, cooperation and respect for international law.\n\nThe vice president quoted independence hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's Jamaica Letter, saying: \"The veil has been torn, we have already seen the light and they want to return us to darkness. The chains have been broken, we have already been free and our enemies intend to enslave us again.\"\n\nShe added that Venezuela \"will never again be a colony of any empire\" and attributed what she called a \"Zionist tint\" to the operation, describing it as \"really shameful.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez pointed to international support from governments in China, Russia, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, saying world leaders were shocked by the attack.\n\nPre-dawn assault\n\nThe assault, which occurred 36 years to the day after the 1990 US invasion of Panama that led to dictator Manuel Noriega's capture, unfolded before dawn as US forces disabled much of Caracas's electrical infrastructure. At least seven explosions rattled the capital over approximately 30 minutes, with blasts reported at military installations and civilian areas.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said American forces had rehearsed the manoeuvres for months, gathering detailed intelligence on Maduro's movements, routines and security arrangements.\n\nRodr\u00edguez reported Venezuelan civilian and military casualties without providing figures, whilst Trump acknowledged some US personnel were injured though none killed.\n\nTrump posted a photograph on social media showing Maduro blindfolded and wearing a tracksuit aboard the warship.\n\nThe Justice Department released a fresh indictment on Saturday charging Maduro and Flores with participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy, describing the administration as a \"corrupt, illegitimate government\" sustained by cocaine trafficking into the United States. Maduro was initially indicted on similar charges in 2020.\n\nThe operation triggered polarised responses on Venezuela's streets, with pro-government supporters gathering in Caracas to protest Maduro's detention whilst others celebrated. Armed civilians and militia members patrolled neighbourhoods long considered ruling party strongholds.\n\nVenezuelan state media reported citizens had mobilised following Maduro's earlier call for activation of the armed forces and Bolivarian militias.\n\nVenezuelan communities abroad also responded, with celebrations reported in the Chilean capital Santiago, Spanish capital Madrid and Doral, Florida, home to the largest Venezuelan diaspora in the United States.\n\nDecree of 'external commotion'\n\nRodr\u00edguez announced activation of a decree signed by Maduro declaring a state of \"external commotion,\" which has been delivered to the Supreme Court president for constitutional endorsement. The decree was expected to receive judicial approval within hours for immediate implementation.\n\nThe military action capped an intensive Trump administration pressure campaign that included a major deployment of American forces off South America's coast and attacks on vessels accused of drug smuggling. Last week, the CIA conducted what was believed to be the first direct strike on Venezuelan territory, targeting a docking facility allegedly used by drug cartels.\n\nTrump told the New York Post that no further troops would deploy to Venezuela \"if the vice president of Maduro does what we want,\" adding that US forces stood ready to launch \"a second wave of attacks much larger than the first.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the operation as a blow to Cuban intelligence and security services, which he said had effectively colonised Venezuela's security apparatus.\n\n\"If I were in Havana, I would be worried even a little bit,\" Rubio said, following Trump's suggestion that Cuba represented \"a very similar case\" for potential US intervention.\n\nTrump subsequently told the New York Post he had no plans for military action against Cuba, asserting the \"failed\" Communist-ruled island \"is going to fall on its own.\"\n\nUnder Venezuelan law, Rodr\u00edguez would constitutionally succeed Maduro as president. The 56-year-old Caracas native, daughter of leftist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, simultaneously holds the finance and oil ministry portfolios alongside her vice-presidential role, making her central to managing the country's struggling economy.\n\nMaduro has described Rodr\u00edguez as \"a tiger\" for her staunch defence of his socialist administration. She works closely with her brother Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, who heads the national assembly.\n\nState television continued broadcasting pro-Maduro programming despite earlier reports that Rodr\u00edguez was in Russia. Her exact whereabouts remained unclear, though state media reported she was in Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela's socialist ruling party has governed since 1999, when former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez assumed office promising to uplift the poor through what he termed a socialist revolution. Maduro, a former bus driver with little education and political experience, succeeded Ch\u00e1vez following his death in 2013 and presided over a decade of increasing authoritarian rule and economic crises which pushed nearly 8mn Venezuelans into exile.\n\nInternational observers widely dismissed Maduro's 2018 re-election as fraudulent due to major opposition parties being barred from participation. In the 2024 contest, electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared him victor hours after polls closed, though the opposition presented evidence, validated by multiple international organisations, suggesting he lost by more than two-to-one.",

But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n\"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" Trump told reporters of Rodr\u00edguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump's first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nIn a major snub, Trump said opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded last year's Nobel Peace Prize, didn't have the support to run the country.\n\nTrump said Rodr\u00edguez had a long conversation with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in which Trump claimed she said, \"'We'll do whatever you need.'\"\n\n\"I think she was quite gracious,\" Trump added. \"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez tried to project strength and unity among the ruling party's many factions, downplaying any hint of betrayal. In remarks on state TV, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and denounced the U.S. operation as a flagrant violation of the United Nations charter.\n\n\"There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\" Rodr\u00edguez said, surrounded by top civilian officials and military commanders.\n\nThere was no immediate sign that the U.S. was running Venezuela.\n\n\"What will happen tomorrow? What will happen in the next hour? Nobody knows,\" Caracas resident Juan Pablo Petrone said.\n\nNo sign of a swearing-in\n\nTrump indicated that Rodr\u00edguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodr\u00edguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n\"What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\" she said. \"History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan constitution also says a new election must be called within a month in the event of the president's absence.\n\nBut experts have been debating whether the succession scenario would apply here, given the government's lack of popular legitimacy and the extraordinary U.S. military intervention.\n\nVenezuelan military officials were quick to project defiance in video messages.\n\n\"They have attacked us but will not break us,\" said Defense Minister Gen. Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, dressed in fatigues.\n\nInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared on state TV in a helmet and flak jacket, urging Venezuelans to \"trust in the political leadership and military\" and \"get out on the streets\" to defend the country's sovereignty.\n\n\"These rats attacked and they will regret what they did,\" he said of the U.S.\n\nStrong ties with Wall Street\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodr\u00edguez has a long history of representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez on the world stage.\n\nShe and her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have strong leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who died in police custody in the 1970s, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro's inner circle, the Rodr\u00edguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S. Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change.\n\nAmong her past interlocutors was Blackwater founder Erik Prince and, more recently, Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy who tried to negotiate a deal with Maduro for greater U.S. influence in Venezuela.\n\nFluent in English, Rodr\u00edguez is sometimes portrayed as a well-educated moderate in contrast to the military hardliners who took up arms with Ch\u00e1vez against Venezuela's democratically elected president in the 1990s.\n\nMany of them, especially Cabello, are wanted in the U.S. on drug trafficking charges and stand accused of serious human rights abuses. But they continue to hold sway over the armed forces, the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela.\n\nThat presents major challenges to Rodr\u00edguez asserting authority. But experts say that Venezuela's power brokers have long had a habit of closing ranks behind their leaders.\n\n\"These leaders have all seen the value of staying united. Cabello has always taken a second seat or third seat, knowing that his fate is tied up with Maduro's, and now he very well might do that again,\" said David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has conducted research into Venezuela's political dynamics over the past three decades.\n\n\"A lot depends on what happened last night, which officials were taken out, what the state of the military looks like now,\" Smilde said. \"If it doesn't have much firepower anymore, they're more vulnerable and diminished and it will be easier for her to gain control.\"\n\nAn apparent snub of the opposition\n\nShortly before Trump's press conference, Machado, the opposition leader, called on her ally Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez -- a retired diplomat widely considered to have won the country's disputed 2024 presidential election -- to \"immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nIn an triumphant statement, Machado promised that her movement would \"restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional country and bring our children back home.\"\n\nShe added: \"Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and take power.\"\n\nAsked about Machado, Trump was blunt: \"I think it would be very tough for (Machado) to be the leader,\" he said.\n\n\"She doesn't have the support or respect within the country.\"\n\nVenezuelans expressed shock, with many speculating on social media that Trump had mixed up the two women's names. Machado has not responded to Trump's remarks.",

She said the operation violated international law and Articles 1 and 2 of the United Nations Charter.",

      "title": "Who is Delcy Rodriguez, the Venezuelan VP in talks with Trump?",
      "body": "The U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela until \"we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,\" Trump said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago detailing the stealthy operation. The U.S. ousted Maduro due to a myriad of concerns, including accusations that he oversaw sham elections, stole oil from the U.S., and helped funnel drugs and notorious Tren de Aragua members into the country.\n\nTrump declined to take a hostile stance against Rodr\u00edguez during the Florida briefing, in which the president said she told Secretary of State Marco Rubio, \"We'll do whatever you need.\" Trump later told the New York Post he would not post U.S. troops in Venezuela if Rodr\u00edguez \"does what we want.\"\n\n\"You have a vice president who's been appointed by Maduro\" in 2018, the president told reporters in the Sunshine State. \"She was sworn in as president just a little while ago. She had a long conversation with Marco, and she said, 'We'll do whatever you need.' I think she was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice. We're going to have this done right. We're not going to just do this with Maduro, then leave like everybody else, leave and say, you know, 'let it go to hell.'\"\n\nWORLD LEADERS REACT TO US ATTACK IN VENEZUELA\n\n\"We're going to be a team that's working with the people of Venezuela to make sure we have Venezuela right,\" he added. \"Because for us to just leave -- who's going to take over? I mean, there is nobody to take over ... if we just left, it would have zero chance of ever coming back. We'll run it properly. We'll run it professionally. We'll have the greatest oil companies in the world going in and invest billions and billions of dollars and take out money, use that money in Venezuela. And the biggest beneficiary is going to be the people of Venezuela, and also, I can't stress this strongly enough, the people that got thrown out of Venezuela that are now in the United States.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56, is known as one of Maduro's closest allies, having held the top position in the country's information, foreign, and oil ministries. Rodr\u00edguez, described by Maduro as a \"tiger\" for her spirited defense of his socialist government, was next in line to succeed Maduro under Venezuela's constitution.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has not announced that Rodriguez was sworn in, and she could be in Russia, which has been a key ally to Maduro, according to Reuters, although Russian state media denied the report.\n\nVENEZUELANS POUR INTO STREETS TO CELEBRATE MADURO'S FALL\n\nIn her first public remarks on Trump's strikes against Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez demanded \"proof of life of President Nicolas Maduro and also the first lady Cilia Flores,\" from the U.S.\n\nVenezuela demands \"the respect of international law\" and condemned \"this complete brutal aggression against our people,\" Rodriguez said, according to TeleSUR English.\n\nThe former Venezuelan first couple is being escorted to New York, where they have been newly indicted and will stand trial, according to the Trump administration.\n\nMar\u00eda Corina Machado, known as Venezuela's leading political opposition to the Maduro regime, could be a top contender to replace Maduro. But Trump downplayed such hopes during his press briefing on Saturday. And Machado has called for 2024 presidential candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez to immediately assume power.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez is in exile in Spain after being widely considered by the U.S. and democratic allies as the legitimate leader in the election, which Maduro claimed he won.\n\nUS IS 'GOING TO RUN' VENEZUELA 'UNTIL A PROPER TRANSITION CAN TAKE PLACE': TRUMP\n\nTrump inferred following Maduro's capture that U.S. officials, including Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, would lead Venezuela during the transition period.\n\nWhen pressed on his relationship with Rodriguez and what role she would continue to play in the country, Trump said that Rubio \"is working on that directly.\"\n\n\"Just had a conversation with her, and she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again, very simple,\" he said.\n\nWHAT IS THE DELTA FORCE? THE US MILITARY UNIT BEHIND THE VENEZUELA RAID TOPPLING MADURO\n\nWhen pressed on why \"running a country in South America is America first,\" Trump replied he believes it is important for the U.S. \"to surround ourselves with good neighbors.\"\n\n\"We want to surround ourselves with stability. We want to surround ourselves with energy. We have tremendous energy in that country. It's very important that we protect it. We need that for ourselves. We need that for the world,\" he told reporters at Mar-a-Lago.",

      "title": "Venezuelan VP Calls for Maduro's Return, Defying Claim From Trump",
      "body": "President Donald Trump said the US will work with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez to transition to a democratically elected government after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture early Saturday, but she and other regime leaders have thus far appeared uncooperative.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio had a lengthy conversation with Rodr\u00edguez and she has agreed to help, Trump said in a news conference in Palm Beach, Florida. He claimed she had already been sworn in as president to succeed Maduro. \"She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again, very simple,\" he said.\n\nMinutes later, in an appearance on state television surrounded by military brass, Rodr\u00edguez called for Maduro's return from US custody, describing his capture as \"barbaric\" and a \"kidnapping,\" and saying Maduro is the country's only president.\n\nIf Rodr\u00edguez is a willing partner, she could help the US ease a transition by maintaining stability with the current institutions in Venezuela. But her long allegiance to Maduro, who is widely viewed as having stolen last year's election, is likely to raise questions about whether she is willing to cede power -- and whether the US is seriously committed to regime change in the South American nation.\n\nRodr\u00edguez didn't respond to requests for comment. On TV, she said that a congressional chamber was preparing an emergency decree, which could offer clues as to how the government plans to operate without Maduro. She also said Venezuela could still have \"respectful relationships,\" perhaps offering a path to a detente with the US.\n\nRodr\u00edguez is considered by many as the most powerful person in the country after Maduro. She is one of his closest allies, rising through the ranks in roles such as information and foreign minister, and was named oil minister in 2024 after the contested presidential vote.\n\nTrump didn't commit to sending US troops to aid in a transition, saying only that his government would help ensure oil infrastructure was protected and improved. He dismissed the idea of installing opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, calling her a \"nice woman\" who doesn't have the support of the Venezuelan people.\n\nTrump's remarks contrasted with the defiant tone from government officials in Venezuela Saturday morning. State television alternated archival footage of Maduro calling for peace \"with dignity\" with statements of support from international allies, and remarks from regional military and civilian leaders rejecting what they described as an attack on the country. Officials repeatedly insisted that Venezuela remained calm, pledged loyalty to Maduro and his socialist agenda, and demanded proof that Maduro was alive.\n\n\"We pledged loyalty many years ago, and today more than ever we will defend it firmly and completely,\" said a person identified on state TV as an official from Yaracuy state. Addressing a crowd of soldiers and civilians, the official asked, \"How is morale?\" The crowd replied in unison: \"High. Long live Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\"\n\nTrump, on the other hand, said the military would need to fall in line.\n\n\"All political and military figures in Venezuela should understand what happened to Maduro can happen to them, and it will happen to them\" if they weren't \"fair\" to the Venezuelan people, he said.\n\nRodr\u00edguez talked Saturday to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose country was among the Venezuela allies that condemned Maduro's capture by US forces.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56, has played a key role in the nation's budget planning and has led diplomatic outreach to consolidate alliances with some of Venezuela's biggest allies, including China and Russia. She recently pressed China to increase purchases of Venezuelan oil and provide diluents needed to keep shipments flowing amid US sanctions.\n\nShe began her political career under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez after graduating as a lawyer from the Central University of Venezuela. Her father, Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, was a prominent figure on the Venezuelan radical left in the 1960s and 1970s and the founder of a Marxist party. He died in 1976 under interrogation in prison after being tortured by state security forces, an event that became a defining part of Delcy's political narrative.\n\nThose who have worked alongside Rodr\u00edguez often remark on her long hours, with Maduro recently saying she responded to messages well into the night and early morning.\n\nLoyal Ally\n\nAlongside Rodr\u00edguez Saturday were the heads of the legislative branch, her brother Jorge Rodr\u00edguez; the judicial branch, Caryslia Rodr\u00edguez, and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez.\n\nJorge Rodr\u00edguez is another key figure in the regime as head of the National Assembly and one of Maduro's closest advisers. The 60-year old psychiatrist became politically active in college, where he was a student leader, and after graduation, he transitioned into government roles.\n\nA loyal ally of Ch\u00e1vez and his successor Maduro, he's held several high-profile political posts, serving as vice president, communications minister and head of the electoral authority. He's also acted as negotiator for the Maduro government in several rounds of talks with the US and the country's opposition.\n\nDespite his mediator role, Rodr\u00edguez is also known for his explosive temperament, lashing out in Congress and publicly threatening and insulting members of the opposition.\n\nJorge Rodr\u00edguez would be a key figure in ensuring continuity and political unity within the ruling party. He was re-elected as a legislator in May 2025 and was expected to take office on Jan. 5.\n\nMilitary Man\n\nAmid rumors that his home had been attacked and that he had been killed, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, 62, was the first senior government official to appear in a video on social media, more than three hours after the unrest began. In the message, he urged Venezuelans to remain calm, backed President Maduro's declaration of a state of emergency, and said national defense measures would be activated to restore order and stability.\n\nPadrino has been Venezuela's defense minister since October 2014, making him one of the longest-serving officials in the government. He was appointed during a tense period marked by large anti-government protests, when Maduro was seeking to strengthen control over the armed forces and secure loyalty at the highest levels. A career army officer trained in Venezuela's traditional military system, Padrino was seen as a figure capable of keeping the military united as the country's political and economic crisis worsened.\n\nDuring Padrino's time in office, the armed forces have taken on roles far beyond national defense. The military now oversees important parts of the economy, including food distribution, ports, mining, and oil-related logistics. This expansion has tied senior officers more closely to the government's survival, giving the military a direct stake in maintaining the current political system.\n\nFollow the latest in global politics.\n\nFollow the latest in global politics.\n\nFollow the latest in global politics.\n\nGet insights from reporters around the world in the Balance of Power newsletter.\n\nGet insights from reporters around the world in the Balance of Power newsletter.\n\nGet insights from reporters around the world in the Balance of Power newsletter.\n\nBloomberg may send me offers and promotions.\n\nPlus Signed UpPlus Sign UpPlus Sign Up\n\nBy submitting my information, I agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.\n\nPadrino has consistently supported Maduro during major moments of unrest, including the 2017 protests, the 2019 challenge following international recognition of Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president, and repeated reports of unrest within the military. He has been sanctioned by the US and other governments, which accuse him of backing authoritarian rule, human rights abuses, and corruption. The US has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture.\n\nVenezuela's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, also appeared on state television early Saturday to urge calm and call for international attention to what he called attacks on areas inhabited by civilians.\n\n\"What they tried to do with bombs and missiles, they achieved partially,\" he said, questioning whether the international community would \"become accomplices to this massacre.\"\n\nCoup Participant\n\nCabello, 62, is the government's socialist party strongman, controlling loyalists and followers across the country, as well as heading prisons, police and intelligence forces, which the United Nations has said enabled crimes against humanity.\n\nAs an army lieutenant, Cabello was part of a handful of young officials led by Ch\u00e1vez responsible for a 1992 coup attempt. After Ch\u00e1vez was elected president, Cabello was appointed to key posts, including minister of housing and telecommunications, head of the National Assembly, and governor of Miranda state.\n\nCabello was a key figure in furthering government controls over the free press and the persecution of politicians, journalists and human rights activists. The US accused Cabello of narco-trafficking and terrorism in 2018. He's charged in a Southern District of New York federal indictment with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism. In 2025 the State Department announced it was raising a reward for information leading to Cabello's capture to as much as $25 million.",

One by one, she introduced figures seated beside her as she asserted that Maduro remains Venezuela's rightful president.\n\n\"There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros,\" Rodr\u00edguez declared to applause, a statement that directly contradicted remarks made earlier by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nHours earlier, Trump held a press conference alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, celebrating Maduro's removal during a pre-dawn U.S. military strike in Caracas. During questioning, Trump claimed that Rubio had spoken with Rodr\u00edguez, that she had been sworn in as president, and that she was willing to cooperate with the United States as it planned to oversee Venezuela's transition and reopen its oil and gas sector to U.S. companies.\n\nTrump said the U.S. intended to extract Venezuela's energy resources to benefit what he called the \"oppressed Venezuelan people\" and to compensate American oil companies forced out under the Maduro government.\n\nRodr\u00edguez sharply rejected that narrative. In her address, she accused Washington of seeking regime change in order to seize Venezuela's natural wealth.\n\n\"With this invasion, the masks have fallen off,\" she said. \"It reveals a single objective, regime change in Venezuela. This regime change would allow for the seizure of our energy, mineral and natural resources. This is the true objective, and the world and the international community must know it.\"\n\nShe warned that the U.S. action had inflicted \"a terrible stain\" on bilateral relations and framed the military operation as a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty, calling on the international community to condemn what she described as imperial aggression.",

Maduro has called her a 'tiger,' reflecting her reputation as a hardline defender of his socialist government and its survival-first political instincts.\n\nShe works closely with her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, a key power broker who leads Venezuela's National Assembly.\n\nHer family roots run deep in Venezuela's revolutionary politics\n\nRodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a left-wing guerrilla figure who founded the revolutionary Liga Socialista party in the 1970s, background that has long shaped how the Rodr\u00edguez family brands itself inside chavismo: revolutionary pedigree, high tolerance for confrontation.\n\nLawyer, messenger, enforcer: how she rose fast\n\nRodr\u00edguez is a lawyer who graduated from the Universidad Central de Venezuela. She moved through high-profile government roles over the past decade, including:\n\nCommunication and Information Minister (2013-2014)\n\nForeign Minister (2014-2017), where she became one of the regime's international faces, aggressive in tone, unapologetic about Venezuela's direction.\n\nA senior role in the pro-government Constituent Assembly, the body that expanded Maduro's powers during Venezuela's political crisis years.\n\nVice President (from 2018), appointed by Maduro as part of a reshuffle after a widely criticised election period.\n\nThe economic operator: finance + oil, at the same time\n\nWhat makes Rodr\u00edguez more than a standard political loyalist is that she has also been an economic manager.\n\nReuters reports she has simultaneously held senior roles tied to finance and oil alongside the vice presidency, a combination that gave her major influence over Venezuela's sanctions-hit economy and the private sector that still functions around it.\n\nIn August 2024, Maduro added the oil ministry to her portfolio, tasking her with managing escalating US sanctions pressure on Venezuela's most important industry.\n\nThe key contradiction: Trump says she's in, she's demanding proof of life\n\nTrump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in touch with Rodr\u00edguez and portrayed her as willing to cooperate with Washington's 'transition.'\n\nBut Reuters reported that on Saturday, an audio message attributed to Rodr\u00edguez was played on Venezuelan state television demanding proof of life for Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, a posture that reads like defiance, not coordination.\n\nThat's the core tension: Trump cast her as Maduro's replacement; her public message, as reported, cast the US claim as an attack requiring proof and accountability.\n\nWhy her name is the succession peg, even if the 'sworn in' claim is disputed\n\nIn any system built around a dominant leader, the deputy becomes the default answer when the leader disappears. Rodr\u00edguez is that default, not because she is universally popular, but because she sits at the intersection of:\n\n* political loyalty (inner circle),\n\n* institutional continuity (vice presidency), and\n\n* economic control (oil and finance portfolios).\n\nIn other words: if the regime needs a face to project continuity, Rodr\u00edguez is the person who can plausibly do it.",

      "title": "Trump Claims Venezuela's VP Has Been 'Sworn In' to Replace Maduro as Uncertainty Deepens",
      "body": "US President Donald Trump has claimed that Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, has been \"sworn in\" as the country's new president following the dramatic capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by US forces, a development that has thrown Venezuela and the wider region into deep political uncertainty.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Saturday, Trump said Rodr\u00edguez had assumed office in the wake of what his administration describes as a US military operation that led to the arrest of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. According to Trump, the transition was part of what he called an effort to \"stabilise Venezuela and begin a proper transition away from years of corruption and failure.\"\n\n\"There is now new leadership in Venezuela,\" Trump said. \"The vice president has been sworn in, and discussions are ongoing about what is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"\n\nHowever, there has been no confirmation from Venezuelan state media, government institutions, or independent sources that Rodr\u00edguez has been sworn in or that any constitutional transfer of power has taken place. Her current whereabouts are also unknown, adding to speculation and confusion surrounding Trump's announcement.\n\nUnder Venezuela's constitution, the removal or incapacity of a sitting president triggers a clearly defined succession process involving the National Assembly and the Supreme Tribunal of Justice. Neither institution has issued a statement confirming Maduro's removal from office or Rodr\u00edguez's installation as president.\n\nOpposition figures inside Venezuela, many of whom have long opposed Maduro, have also expressed caution. Some warned that any leadership change imposed externally would lack legitimacy and risk plunging the country into further instability.\n\n\"This is not how constitutional transitions happen,\" said one opposition lawmaker, speaking anonymously due to security concerns. \"Venezuela cannot be governed by press conferences in Florida or Washington.\"\n\nRodr\u00edguez has been one of the most influential figures in Venezuela's government for more than a decade. A former foreign minister, she has played a central role in managing the country's battered economy amid sweeping US sanctions, currency collapse, and chronic shortages.\n\nThe daughter of Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a left-wing guerrilla fighter who died in police custody in the 1970s, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez rose through the ranks of Venezuela's political elite alongside her brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, now president of the National Assembly. She is widely regarded as a disciplined, hardline loyalist of the Bolivarian revolution, though also a pragmatic operator in negotiations with foreign actors.\n\nTrump claimed that Rodr\u00edguez had spoken directly with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and had signalled a willingness to cooperate with Washington. \"She understands what needs to be done,\" Trump said, without providing details of any agreement.\n\nLegal experts, regional leaders, and human rights organisations have condemned the US operation that led to Maduro's capture, describing it as a violation of international law and Venezuelan sovereignty.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva earlier warned that forcibly removing leaders sets a dangerous precedent. \"This opens the door to a world where might replaces law,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nThe United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, Ben Saul, also criticised what he described as the \"illegal abduction\" of a sitting head of state, calling for immediate clarification of Maduro's legal status and access to due process.\n\nTrump's claim of a new Venezuelan leadership has heightened anxiety across Latin America, particularly in Cuba, which relies heavily on Venezuelan oil supplies. Analysts warn that any abrupt political shift in Caracas could deepen humanitarian crises and destabilise already fragile economies.\n\nUS officials have not clarified whether Washington recognises Rodr\u00edguez as Venezuela's legitimate leader or whether a US-administered interim authority remains in place, as Trump earlier suggested the United States would \"run the country\" until a transition is completed.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, key questions remain unresolved:\n\nUntil those questions are answered, Venezuela appears caught in a dangerous political limbo -- one shaped less by domestic processes than by extraordinary external intervention.\n\nMore developments are expected in the coming hours.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Editor's Note: For content partnerships and collaborations, reach out via editor@naija247news.com\n\nReporting by David Okoroafor, News Writer in Lagos, Nigeria.",

      "body": "(New York, New York) - Questions continue to swirl over who is leading Venezuela - and from where - following the reported capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by U.S. forces and the apparent absence of senior government officials from public view.\n\nAccording to multiple sources cited by Reuters, Venezuela's vice president and oil minister Delcy Rodr\u00edguez is currently in Russia, while her brother, National Assembly President Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, remains in Caracas. The split locations of top officials have deepened uncertainty about who is exercising executive authority inside the country.\n\nRodr\u00edguez appeared earlier Saturday in an audio message aired on state television demanding proof of life for Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Jorge Rodr\u00edguez has not made a public appearance since the U.S. operation, further clouding the question of succession.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, President Donald Trump said the United States will effectively \"run\" Venezuela following the operation. When asked whether the U.S. presence could become an extended stay, Trump said it would not cost the United States anything and that American forces would remain in the country \"as long as we feel comfortable.\"\n\nThe comments suggest a potentially prolonged U.S. role in Venezuela at a moment when the country's constitutional leadership structure appears unclear. With senior officials either abroad or silent and U.S. forces asserting control, it remains unresolved who Venezuela's next president is -- and where that authority is being exercised.",

      "title": "With Maduro in US custody, who governs in Venezuela?",
      "body": "With disbelief, shock, and confusion, after more than 20 weeks of political tension, Venezuela awoke to the news of the arrest of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, following a combined military operation by U.S. forces in Caracas. The question now is what will happen to Chavismo and who will assume power.\n\nWith Maduro and Flores detained, the 1999 Constitution stipulates that the vice president, in this case Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, a close confidante of the president, assumes the reins of the executive branch. Her brother Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, president of the National Assembly, is third in the line of succession. Diosdado Cabello, the country's second most powerful figure, would retain his position as Minister of the Interior and guardian of the pro-government civilian-military establishment.\n\nThe whereabouts of Delcy Rodr\u00edguez are unclear after Reuters reported that she was in Russia. The New York Times, however, reported hours later that she was in Caracas.\n\nThe silence of the early morning was shattered suddenly and unexpectedly around 2:00 a.m. in Caracas -- and also in the states of Aragua, Miranda, and La Guaira. This is the first foreign military aggression in the history of the country. Details regarding the number of casualties are not yet available. The operation targeted key locations of the Chavista regime's civilian-military power base. According to initial reports, the attacks included the famous Mountain Barracks, formerly the Military History Museum, in the west of the city, where Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's remains are interred.\n\nDespite Maduro's capture, the Chavista regime has yet to show any signs of cracking. The Bolivarian Revolution is deeply entrenched in the Venezuelan state, a situation that transcends Maduro's presence in Miraflores Palace.\n\nOn the streets of Caracas, disbelief, caution, and fear prevail: the memory of the military repression of recent years is still very much alive. In the cities of the interior, there is calm. Security forces are gradually taking to the streets. The most outspoken members of the ruling party appeared in the early hours to condemn the announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump, demand news about Maduro's whereabouts, and denounce violations of international law and national sovereignty.\n\nThe issue currently obsessing Chavista militants is the whereabouts of Maduro and Flores. Vice President Rodr\u00edguez demanded information about the fate of the president and his wife, and asked Trump for \"immediate proof of life.\" The Republican later published a photograph of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima on his social media platform, Truth. Rodr\u00edguez, like other Chavista leaders, has implied that the Chavista regime is fully aware of what it must do to guarantee territorial integrity and the presence of the revolutionary leadership in power. A State of Internal Disturbance has already been declared, a measure that will militarize daily life and have clear consequences for the nation. Rodr\u00edguez emphasized that Maduro \"has given very clear instructions to the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, so that, in perfect civic-military, popular, and police unity, all plans for the defense of the nation are activated.\"\n\nAt the crack of dawn, Diosdado Cabello, the regime's second-in-command, appeared on state-run Venezolana de Televisi\u00f3n, clad in tactical vest and helmet and surrounded by members of the political police. Cabello called the U.S. attack \"treacherous and vile\" and urged his supporters \"not to lose their composure, to avoid despair.\" \"Avoid situations that favor the invading enemy,\" he said. Cabello questioned the role of \"international organizations\" in this crisis, accusing them of being \"complicit in a massacre of civilians.\" The leader addressed his men on camera with the two central slogans of the regime's security forces: \"Always loyal, never traitors\" and \"To doubt is treason.\"\n\nVladimir Padrino, Minister of Defense and a key figure in the Bolivarian Revolution, denounced Washington's explicit intention to \"provoke regime change\" and described the events as \"the most serious outrage in our entire history.\" Padrino called for calm among the citizens and asked them to trust the Armed Forces. \"Faced with this vile and cowardly attack, which threatens the peace and stability of the region, we issue the strongest possible condemnation to the international community so that the U.S. government is held accountable,\" he said. Padrino confirmed the deployment of all the country's military forces within the territory.\n\nBoth Venezuelan Foreign Minister Iv\u00e1n Gil and Attorney General Tarek William Saab called on the international community to expressly condemn the military attack perpetrated against the country. Gil demanded \"an immediate statement from the UN Security Council.\" Saab denounced that \"many innocent civilians have been killed in this hour. This threat of bloodshed has materialized. I call on the people to be vigilant, and I call on the country's prosecutors to be attentive to the consequences of these cowardly attacks.\"\n\nThe segments of the Venezuelan political opposition that are still tolerated within the country have, so far, maintained a prudent silence. In exile, however, the situation has been different. Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, the recent Nobel Peace Prize laureate, stated in a lengthy communiqu\u00e9 that they are ready to seize power. \"We are going to restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional country, and bring our children home,\" the opposition leader promised, adding that she will announce the next steps of her movement through her official social media accounts.",

(Source: Bloomberg)\n\nWith Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in US custody, his top lieutenants quickly took to social media and state television early Saturday to fill the power vacuum, taking a defiant stand against the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News Saturday that the US is reviewing what a transition of power will look like in Venezuela. Meanwhile, the regime's most prominent leaders were already asserting their authority over their nation's military and government.\n\nThe key for Maduro's inner circle to maintain control will be to retain the loyalty of the nation's armed forces. Thus far there has been no sign of dissent in the ranks, and the streets of Caracas were quiet early Saturday as Venezuelans waited cautiously to see what would happen next.\n\nVice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez would be next in line to succeed Maduro under Venezuela's constitution. She spoke by phone with state television Saturday, calling for national unity and rejecting foreign interference, and talked to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Her current whereabouts haven't been disclosed, and the Russian government said a report that she was in Russia was false.\n\n\"They have a vice president as you know,\" Trump told Fox, when asked who would succeed Maduro. He said he would also consider whether opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado should be in charge. The objective would be to avoid a situation where the US has to remove another leader, Trump said.\n\n\"We can't take a chance after having done this incredible thing last night of letting somebody else take over, where we have to do it again,\" he said.\n\nMachado, for her part, said the candidate she backed in last year's election, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, should immediately assume power, and called on the armed forces to back him. But Gonz\u00e1lez has been in exile in Spain, and Machado has yet to return to Venezuela after traveling to Sweden last month to accept her Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nRodr\u00edguez is considered by many as the most powerful person in the country after Maduro. She is one of his closest allies, rising through the ranks in roles such as information and foreign minister, and was named oil minister in 2024 after the contested presidential vote.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 56, has played a key role in the nation's budget planning and has led diplomatic outreach to consolidate alliances with some of Venezuela's biggest allies, including China and Russia. She recently pressed China to increase purchases of Venezuelan oil and provide diluents needed to keep shipments flowing amid US sanctions.\n\nShe began her political career under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez after graduating as a lawyer from the Central University of Venezuela. Her father, Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, was a prominent figure on the Venezuelan radical left in the 1960s and 1970s and the founder of a Marxist party. He died in 1976 under interrogation in prison after being tortured by state security forces, an event that became a defining part of Delcy's political narrative.\n\nThose who have worked alongside Rodr\u00edguez often remark on her long hours, with Maduro recently saying she responded to messages well into the night and early morning.",

Speaking by phone with state-run broadcaster VTV, Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez said the regime had lost contact with both Maduro and Flores and demanded that Washington provide what she called \"proof of life,\" an extraordinary on-air concession from a government that has long projected absolute control.\n\n\"In light of this brutal situation and this brutal attack, we do not know the whereabouts of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores,\" Rodr\u00edguez said during the broadcast, accusing the United States of having \"violated, attacked, and assaulted\" Venezuela. She repeatedly pressed the Trump administration to account for Maduro and Flores, framing the operation as an act of aggression rather than addressing the disappearance itself. Rodr\u00edguez went on to claim Maduro had warned Venezuelans such an operation could happen, blaming what she described as American \"energy greed\" for the strike.\n\nReuters is reporting that the Venezuelan VP is in Russia, according to four sources.\n\nPosted by: Bulg",

      "body": "US President Donald Trump's administration claimed that it conducted a \"large-scale strike\" in Venezuela early Saturday morning. The attack included the capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores, who are reportedly being transported to face criminal charges in the US.\n\nWitnesses reported at least seven explosions in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, around 4:30 AM on Saturday. The attack lasted less than 30 minutes. Casualty reports were not immediately available.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration has since banned US commercial flights over Venezuelan airspace because of \"ongoing military activity.\" President Trump stated that additional details are to come on the matter and that he will hold a news conference at 11:00 AM.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez condemned the act, stating it constitutes a flagrant violation of the UN Charter and threatens international peace and stability. Vice President Rodr\u00edguez also said that her government does not know the whereabouts of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores, demanding that the US government provide proof of life.\n\nPresident Maduro and First Lady Flores will reportedly face criminal charges. In 2020, Maduro and 14 other government officials were indicted in the Southern District of New York for what then-US Attorney General William Barr said was conspiring with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and \"causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities.\"\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said the attack and capture of Maduro marks \"[a] new dawn for Venezuela,\" claiming that \"[t]he tyrant is gone.\"\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry condemned what it called a US \"act of armed aggression,\" stating that \"Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, outside intervention.\" Russia also agreed with calls for an emergency UN Security Council meeting. US Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted his concerns on X, stating, \"I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.\"\n\nThis morning's attacks come after a long series of attacks on Venezuelan boats by the US military. As of Friday, the number of known boat strikes was 35, and the number of people killed was at least 115, according to the Trump administration. Tensions have steadily built between the two nations. The US announced sanctions against four oil companies operating in Venezuela on Wednesday. There have also been legal disputes over due process for Venezuelan migrants and allegations that Venezuelans who were deported to El Salvador by the US were tortured.",

His captivity has raised a question over who would run the country if Maduro is no longer in power.\n\nUnder Venezuela's Constitution, the Vice President becomes the acting head of state in case the president is incapacitated or removed. Hence, Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez appears to be the most probable contender to take over the power of Venezuela. Rodr\u00edguez, who is a close ally of Maduro, has served as the Vice President since 2018. She previously served as the Foreign Minister and UN Ambassador.\n\nCiting sources, US Journalist Laura Loomer claimed that Rodr\u00edguez is going to be announced as the interim President of Venezuela.\n\nIn a post on X, Loomer said, \"The Vice President of Venezuela is going to be announced as the interim President of Venezuela today following US airstrikes on Venezuela and the announcement by President Trump that Nicolas Maduro has been \"captured\" by US Special Forces and flown out of the country.\"\n\nHowever, the situation is complicated by Venezuela's long-running political crisis and disputed electoral processes. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is also a possible contender to take the place of Maduro.",

  "executive_brief": "A significant political and military event has unfolded in Venezuela, marked by a reported US military strike and the capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores, as announced by US President Donald Trump. This event is receiving substantial media coverage (103 articles from 84 sources) and is overwhelmingly viewed negatively (average sentiment score of -0.45), suggesting widespread concern and disapproval. The situation is further complicated by the uncertainty surrounding Maduro\u2019s whereabouts, initially acknowledged by Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, and the subsequent assumption of the interim presidency by Rodr\u00edguez herself. \n\nStakeholder positions are sharply divided. Donald Trump asserts US \u201ccharge\u201d over Venezuela and has offered rewards for the capture of key figures like Diosdado Cabello, while Delcy Rodr\u00edguez oscillates between condemnation of the US actions and a surprising willingness to cooperate. The financial implications are substantial, with Venezuela possessing vast mineral wealth (USD 1,360,000,000,000) and crude oil reserves (303,000,000,000 barrels), attracting significant US oil company investment (USD 1,000,000,000) and potential extraction of funds (USD 1,000,000,000). The situation also involves accusations of external influences, with Rodr\u00edguez citing \u201cZionist\u201d overtones and Trump targeting Colombia\u2019s leadership.",
