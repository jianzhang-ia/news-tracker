      "title": "Hydrogen Forklifts Are A Rounding Error, Not A Rebuttal",
      "body": "Someone responded to a just-published article about yet another hydrogen fleet failure by pointing to hydrogen fuel cell forklifts in US distribution centers. The implication was clear. If hydrogen works in forklifts, then the broader critique of hydrogen transport must be flawed. It is a familiar move. It is also deeply flawed and biased. I don't even consider the argument to be in good faith, it's so weak. They are reaching for an example that sounds tangible. Invoking hydrogen forklifts as evidence that hydrogen transport is winning requires ignoring scale so completely that the argument collapses on contact with basic statistics.\n\nThe core problem is denominators. Any claim about success or failure that relies on a numerator without a denominator is meaningless. This is not a matter of opinion or ideology. It is elementary statistics. A few thousand units can sound impressive in isolation. The moment those units are placed against millions of comparable assets, the interpretation changes completely. Continuing to claim validation after that comparison is made is not a mistake. It is intellectual dishonesty. When hydrogen forklifts are used as a defense of hydrogen transport, the numerator is doing all the work, and the denominator is being deliberately ignored.\n\nGlobally, forklifts are a large and mature industrial market. Annual sales are in the range of 2.2 million units, according to the long-running World Industrial Truck Statistics dataset. Roughly 70% of those forklifts are battery electric. Most of the remainder are diesel, LPG, or CNG. Hydrogen fuel cell forklifts are measured in the low thousands per year. That puts hydrogen well below 0.1% of global forklift sales, hence the lack of the line for them even showing up on this chart even though they are in the data set that generated it. At that scale, hydrogen is not a niche contender. It is a rounding error. Claiming that a technology is succeeding based on a share that rounds to zero is not analysis. It is narrative defense.\n\nIt's well worth noting that World Industrial Truck Statistics understates total forklift volumes. The undercount is overwhelmingly on the electric side, not hydrogen. China produces and deploys hundreds of thousands of electric forklifts each year, particularly Class 3 pallet trucks and walk-behind units that never enter export statistics and are inconsistently reported into Western datasets. China is far more electrified in material handling than North America or Europe. When those units are fully accounted for, the global denominator grows to around 3 million, and the electric share increases. Hydrogen does not benefit from this correction. Its relative share shrinks further.\n\nZooming in to the United States does not rescue the argument. The US market sells on the order of 900,000 to 1,000,000 forklifts per year, depending on whether one looks at shipments or orders. Battery electric forklifts dominate US indoor logistics, with 70% of those annual sales being electric, and only 50,000 to 60,000 hydrogen forklifts in total after more than a dozen years of sales. Internal combustion forklifts retain a presence in heavier and outdoor applications. Hydrogen forklifts become more visible than they are globally, but visibility is not dominance. Even in the US, hydrogen forklifts represent a small fraction of electric forklifts, and a tiny fraction of total forklifts. The denominator still matters. Shrinking the frame does not change the math.\n\nAt this point, defenders of hydrogen almost always pivot to the same examples. Amazon. Walmart. Home Depot. These are the largest US distribution systems, and they are often presented as proof that hydrogen forklifts have won at scale. This is where selective disclosure becomes central to the misunderstanding. Hydrogen forklift counts are sometimes disclosed by these firms or by their supplier, Plug Power. Total forklift fleets are not. That asymmetry creates a distorted picture. When only hydrogen numbers are visible, it is easy for motivated readers to assume hydrogen is dominant. It is not.\n\nWalmart provides the clearest historical anchor. In 2016, Walmart disclosed that it had roughly 4,200 hydrogen forklifts, representing about 20% of its US forklift fleet. That implies a total fleet of about 21,000 forklifts at the time. Since then, Walmart has increased its hydrogen forklift count to roughly 9,500 to 10,000 units, according to trade press and supplier statements. What Walmart has not disclosed is its current total forklift fleet. Without that denominator, hydrogen growth cannot be interpreted as dominance. Even if the total fleet doubled since 2016, hydrogen would remain a minority technology inside Walmart's operations.\n\nAmazon discloses that it operates more than 15,000 hydrogen fuel cell forklifts in the United States, with a stated target of around 20,000. That sounds large until it is placed in context. Amazon operates hundreds of fulfillment centers, sortation centers, and delivery stations across North America. Logistics engineering benchmarks show that a large fulfillment center commonly operates 150 to 300 forklifts across multiple shifts. Smaller facilities operate fewer, but they are numerous. Using publicly available facility counts and conservative per-facility forklift ranges, Amazon's US forklift fleet plausibly sits in the high tens of thousands. Under those conditions, hydrogen forklifts are not dominant. They are a subset, concentrated in specific facilities and specific classes of equipment.\n\nHome Depot follows the same pattern, but with even less disclosure. It has used hydrogen forklifts in some distribution centers since the mid-2010s. No public source provides a comprehensive count of either hydrogen forklifts or total forklifts across its US operations. Estimation using facility counts and standard forklift densities again yields a fleet where hydrogen is present but clearly secondary to battery electric equipment. The absence of published totals does not imply hydrogen dominance. It simply reflects normal corporate reporting practices.\n\nEstimating forklift fleets responsibly starts with facility counts that companies themselves disclose. Amazon operates on the order of 175 large fulfillment centers in the United States, alongside several hundred smaller sortation and delivery facilities. Warehouse design and material handling studies from firms like MHI members and major integrators consistently show that a large fulfillment center typically operates between 150 and 300 forklifts across multiple shifts, while smaller facilities operate between 20 and 80. Using the low end of those ranges yields a rough estimate of 175 large facilities times 150 forklifts, or about 26,000 forklifts, plus 250 smaller sites times 30 forklifts, or another 7,500. Even conservative assumptions therefore put Amazon's US forklift fleet in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 units.\n\nWalmart provides a useful cross-check because it disclosed both hydrogen forklift counts and total fleet share earlier in its adoption cycle. In 2016, Walmart reported roughly 4,200 hydrogen forklifts, representing about 20% of its US forklift fleet, implying a total of approximately 21,000 forklifts at that time. Walmart has since increased its hydrogen forklift count to around 9,500 to 10,000 units, based on supplier disclosures and trade reporting. Even if Walmart's total forklift fleet grew only modestly since 2016, hydrogen forklifts would still account for well under half of the fleet. Any reasonable growth in total forklifts only pushes hydrogen's share lower.\n\nNational forklift stock estimates provide an outer bound that keeps these calculations grounded. The United States is estimated to have on the order of 3 million forklifts in operation across all sectors. For Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot combined to operate, for example, 150,000 forklifts would imply they control around 5% of all US forklifts, which already stretches plausibility. Placing their combined fleets in the tens of thousands aligns with both facility-based estimates and disclosed hydrogen counts. Across all of these methods, hydrogen forklifts remain a minority technology even inside the most hydrogen-friendly firms in the United States.\n\nIt is also important to understand why forklifts were ever considered a hydrogen niche in the first place. The original appeal had little to do with hydrogen being inherently superior. It was a response to the limits of lead-acid batteries. Long charging times, battery swapping labor, and space constraints created operational pain in multi-shift warehouses. Hydrogen offered fast refueling and consistent power output. That advantage was real for a time. It was also temporary. Lithium-ion batteries eliminated most of those constraints. Fast charging, opportunity charging, lower maintenance, and falling costs erased hydrogen's operational edge. Hydrogen did not lose because of ideology. It was overtaken by better and of course cheaper electric technology.\n\nDirect public support for hydrogen forklifts in the United States is real and well documented. The most explicit federal intervention came through the Department of Energy's Fuel Cell Technologies Office under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. DOE reports show roughly $9.7 million in federal grant funding directed specifically at fuel cell lift truck deployments, paired with about $11.8 million in industry cost share. Those programs supported the deployment of just under 700 hydrogen fuel cell forklifts and included funding for on-site hydrogen refueling equipment, training, and data collection. The onsite refueling infrastructure made the fuel cell lifts sticky of course, making it lower friction to buy a few more hydrogen forklifts rather than just using battery electric as almost everybody does. Individual awards within that program included roughly $6.1 million for GENCO, $1.3 million for a FedEx Freight deployment covering 35 forklifts at a single facility, and around $1.1 million associated with Nuvera. These grants were explicitly intended to seed early markets and reduce first-mover risk, not to demonstrate unsubsidized commercial competitiveness.\n\nBeyond direct grants, hydrogen forklifts and their fueling infrastructure have benefited from tax-based subsidies that are harder to total because they are claimed privately and reported only in aggregate. DOE materials and IRS guidance make clear that fuel cells used in material handling have been eligible for an investment tax credit of up to 30% of capital cost or up to $3,000 per kW, depending on the year and program structure. Hydrogen dispensing equipment has also been eligible for the Section 30C alternative fuel refueling credit, which after recent legislative updates can cover up to 30% of installed cost for qualifying business property, subject to location and labor requirements. These incentives can materially improve project economics at individual sites, but there is no public ledger showing how much has been claimed specifically for forklift fleets, which makes it impossible to produce a precise total subsidy figure from tax credits alone.\n\nThe broader hydrogen forklift ecosystem has also been supported indirectly through large-scale federal financing for Plug Power, which supplies most of the fuel cells, fueling equipment, and hydrogen to these fleets. In 2024 and 2025, the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office finalized a loan guarantee on the order of $1.6 billion to support Plug Power's hydrogen production and liquefaction projects. This was not a grant and does not target forklifts directly, but it clearly lowers financing risk and capital costs for the hydrogen supply network that companies like Amazon and Walmart rely on for their forklift operations. Taken together, the record shows that hydrogen forklifts in the United States emerged and persisted in a subsidy-rich environment that combined early deployment grants, ongoing tax credits, state-level clean fuel programs in places like California, and large federal financial backing for the dominant supplier. What cannot be known without access to confidential tax filings is the full cumulative value of those subsidies. What can be said with confidence is that hydrogen forklifts did not scale in the absence of public support, and their continued use reflects that policy history as much as it does operational choice.\n\nIn recent months Plug Power's financial position has shifted to desperate retrenchment and cuts to the bone, with direct implications for hydrogen forklift operators in the United States. After securing the large Department of Energy loan guarantee intended to finance multiple hydrogen production and liquefaction facilities, the company later signaled that it would not proceed with those projects under the loan structure. That decision reflects ongoing liquidity pressure and an effort to avoid taking on additional obligations tied to long-dated, capital-intensive infrastructure. At the same time, Plug Power has reduced operating and maintenance spending, deferred projects, and narrowed its focus to preserving cash and maintaining existing customer commitments rather than building out the vertically integrated hydrogen network it previously promised. As I noted, cuts to maintenance of industrial hydrogen generation facilities increase risk substantially, and my first hope is that no staff are harmed in yet another hydrogen explosion or fire, ending up Hydrogen Insights' mounting list of incidents, injuries and fatalities.\n\nFor operators running hydrogen forklift fleets, this retrenchment introduces new uncertainty. Hydrogen supply arrangements that were originally marketed as stable, vertically integrated, and increasingly low cost now depend more heavily on third-party sourcing and short-term commercial contracts. Cost control measures at Plug Power also raise questions about the long-term robustness of maintenance, service, and refueling support for installed forklift fleets. Even if day-to-day operations continue, the shift in strategy underscores that hydrogen forklifts in the United States are tied to a supplier ecosystem under financial strain, not to a self-sustaining market. That risk profile matters when hydrogen forklifts are presented as evidence of a technology that has already won.\n\nWhat remains today is path dependence. Hydrogen forklifts persist where infrastructure was built early and where replacement cycles are slow. Persistence is not validation. A technology can survive in a niche without ever being competitive at scale. Confusing the two is the deeper analytical error. Forklifts are simply the clearest illustration because the numbers are so stark and the market is so mature.\n\nWhat the commenter on the previous article was doing is not subtle, and it has a name. It is base rate neglect, the most basic statistical error, where a numerator is presented as meaningful while the denominator is ignored. Pointing to a few tens of thousands of hydrogen forklifts in the United States while disregarding millions of forklifts sold globally each year, and the overwhelming dominance of battery electric equipment is not analysis.\n\nLayered on top of that is the logical fallacy of cherry-picking, selecting the one geography and one niche where hydrogen is most visible while ignoring readily available global data and the much higher electrification rates in places like China. The behavior is driven by motivated reasoning, where evidence is filtered to defend a prior belief rather than test it. The statistical language they tend to use gives the appearance of literacy, but the reasoning violates the first rules anyone trained in statistics would apply. Once scale and base rates have been explained, continuing to present a rounding error as validation is no longer confusion. It is an intellectually dishonest attempt to signal expertise while ignoring the weight of the evidence. It's a sign of deep cognitive biases that they refuse to even consider, never mind overcome.\n\nA related rhetorical move appears when advocates point to claims such as a 40% year over year increase in hydrogen transportation sales in South Korea. A figure like that is designed to sound decisive, because large percentages trigger salience. They feel like momentum. What is almost always missing is the base rate. If hydrogen transportation sales start from a very small number, then a 40% increase still leaves the category trivial when set against the overall transport market. The percentage is doing the persuasive work precisely because the absolute numbers are unimpressive. This is base rate neglect and denominator blindness combined with a salience trick, where an eye-catching growth rate crowds out the more important question of scale. Growth rates only become meaningful when the underlying denominator is large enough to matter. Without that context, a 40% increase is not evidence of success. It is a way of making a rounding error feel significant.\n\nI have addressed the irrelevancy of US hydrogen forklifts before, but buried it in articles and comments. It was time to devote some time and space to it so that next time someone tries to waste someone's time by pointing to it, I can just paste in the article and move on. As I've noted in the past, far too large a portion of my publications can be explained by the XKCD cartoon Duty Calls.\n\nThis matters beyond forklifts. The same rhetorical pattern appears across hydrogen buses, trucks, trains, and other transport applications. A small surviving deployment is treated as proof of viability, while the denominator is ignored. Scale is optional only in narratives. In real energy systems, scale is everything. Technologies that cannot move beyond rounding errors do not fail morally. They fail mathematically. Hydrogen forklifts do not rescue hydrogen transport. They demonstrate its limits.\n\nAdvocates for hydrogen for energy, whether heading European hydrogen lobbying organizations or simply boneheaded commenters on the internet, persistently make these kind of rhetorical arguments, show this willing blindness to empirical reality and spew logical fallacies as if they are gotchas. It's remarkable that they get away with it so often. It's even more remarkable that they can look themselves in the mirror and pretend to intellectual rigor and statistical competence. Personally, I'd be deeply ashamed.",

      "body": "JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) - Many countries are still pursuing the development of platinum- and iridium-using green hydrogen infrastructure, including China where green hydrogen features in the latest Five-Year Plan to 2030.\n\nThe globally active Heraeus adds in its 2026 forecast just out that a return to demand growth in the hydrogen sector is anticipated, though it is not yet clear how much this will impact the iridium market, which the Hanau-based company expects to trade at between $3 800/oz and $5 150/oz in 2026.\n\nWith PGM prices being much higher than at the start of 2025, South African mining companies now have much better margins and some small projects ramping up are adding small amounts of iridium to South African output, Heraeus, which has a long-standing South African presence, points out in a release to Mining Weekly.\n\nBeing used along with iridium in green hydrogen electrolysers is ruthenium, another PGM, which is also being used in a variety of other hydrogen-related processes.\n\nWithin the push to further develop green hydrogen, China's Five-Year Plan from 2026 to 2030 seemingly includes hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles and the ruthenium price is forecast to trade between $600/oz and $975/oz in 2026.\n\nThe Heraeus report estimates that platinum is estimated to trade at between $1 300/oz and $1 800/oz in 2026, when platinum's deficit is expected to shrink.\n\nSouth Africa's platinum output is predicted by Heraeus to be somewhat higher in 2026, partly owing to the processing of work-in-progress stock that was built up during processing plant maintenance, and partly owing to the ramp-up of some new operations.\n\nThe recovery in PGM prices during 2025 improved the mining companies' margins which makes further cuts to production unlikely.\n\nSecondary recycled platinum supply is anticipated by Heraeus to rise modestly next year. In Europe, scrap autocatalyst volumes are predicted to rise with heavy-duty vehicle sales forecast to see robust growth globally, leading to greater numbers of scrapped commercial vehicles.\n\nPrimary palladium production is forecast to increase by 1% to 6.2-milion ounces next year and the rally in the PGM prices has helped to uplift secondary palladium supply.\n\nIndustrial use of rhodium is projected by Heraeus to rise modestly next year amid moderate growth in the chemical sector and marginally higher primary supply.\n\nSecondary rhodium supply is predicted by Heraeus to rise in 2026 when rhodium prices are expected to be between $6 000/oz and $9 000/oz.\n\nHeraeus, which covers the value chain from trading to refining and recycling, has extensive PGM insight.\n\nKey hydrogen systems of Heraeus group laboratories went live in China in October, where rapid growth is reported in the platinum-catalysed proton exchange membrane (PEM) green hydrogen technology that is poised to play a central decarbonisation role.\n\nThe laboratories were described as reflecting China's rapid pace of hydrogen innovation.\n\nThe cost-efficient production of green hydrogen - on the industrial scale that China can provide - will be an important contributor towards a zero-emission society, on a planet increasingly threatened by climate disruption.\n\nA return to demand growth in the hydrogen sector is anticipated by Heraeus in its 2026 forecast report, which points to some Chinese companies having developed PEM electrolysers.",

      "title": "China considers platinum strategic critical mineral, WPIC Asia Pacific head points out",
      "body": "JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) - China considers platinum a critical mineral with strategic value owing to its importance in new energy technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells and electrolysers to produce hydrogen.\n\nChina, which has negligible domestic platinum group metal (PGM) resources, has thus invested in physical platinum through its new Guangzhou Futures Exchange (GFEX), which is a natural mechanism for attracting metal to supply future industrial demand.\n\nThe GFEX enhances platinum and palladium liquidity and is supportive of industrial development and growth.\n\nWorld Platinum Investment Council (WPIC) regional head Asia Pacific Weibin Deng provided this important insight to Mining Weekly on the interesting significance of last week's launch on the GFEX of platinum and palladium futures and options.\n\n\"For the first time, domestic industrial users and fabricators have a direct, regulated tool to hedge against global platinum and palladium price volatility.\n\n\"Previously, many were exposed to this risk without an efficient hedging mechanism,\" explained Deng, who described the GFEX as being \"transformative\" for China's PGMs market.\n\n\"The ability to enter into platinum and palladium futures contracts enhances price stability for key industries and it is expected to narrow the spreads on platinum jewellery and investment products - meaning lower premiums for buyers and smaller discounts on buybacks.\n\n\"Ultimately, this boosts consumer confidence and supports demand growth, while also encouraging a more robust domestic recycling ecosystem,\" Deng noted.\n\nThis initiative directly supports China's national strategic priorities amid the GFEX mandate being to develop financial instruments that serve the real economy.\n\nGiven China's strong focus on the energy transition and decarbonisation, platinum and palladium have been prioritised to the benefit of South Africa, which hosts more PGMs than any other country.\n\nThe approval of platinum and palladium aligns with China's national agenda to secure supply chains and manage risk for what have become essential raw materials for all countries that are pursuing a cleaner and greener planet to save Mother Earth from climate catastrophe.\n\nThese are Deng's replies to a series of questions put to him:\n\nWhat has prompted GFEX to make these products available now?\n\nThis initiative directly supports China's national strategic priorities. GFEX's mandate is to develop financial instruments that serve the real economy. Given the government's strong focus on the energy transition and decarbonisation, platinum and palladium have been prioritised. The approval of these products aligns with the national agenda to secure supply chains and manage risk for these essential raw materials.\n\nWhat are the contracts' key features and how do they align with other markets?\n\nGFEX offers innovative bi-monthly contracts, similar to those offered by Japan Exchange Group, with frequent opportunities for platinum and palladium risk management. A truly unique feature is the acceptance of both ingots and sponge for physical delivery. No other global exchange allows delivery of sponge, pure metal in a powder form which is most needed by industrial and automotive end-users. This ensures that contracts meet the precise needs of the real economy. Furthermore, the delivery mechanism is robust. Metal is accepted from both approved domestic refiners and international suppliers accredited by the London Platinum and Palladium Market, ensuring trustworthy and reliable physical settlement.\n\nWill GFEX's platinum and palladium contracts promote greater integration with global commodities markets?\n\nBy making the contracts available to both institutions and individuals domestically and, in due course, internationally, GFEX creates a new, accessible benchmark using China's own local Renminbi currency. Enhanced cross-market arbitrage opportunities will increase market liquidity, opening platinum up as an investment to larger pools of assets under management. For asset managers in China, it formally places platinum as a viable investment asset class. Market transparency will also be improved through the publication of GFEX's daily warehouse inventory updates.\n\nDo you see this development changing WPIC's forecast for investment demand in China?\n\nThere may be a one-time demand uplift from platinum warehoused to back margin requirements, the stocks of which could increase as trading volumes on the exchange increase. A margin deposit is the initial amount of money a trader must put down to open a leveraged trading position. It acts as collateral and is a percentage of the full value of the trade. WPIC's initial supply and demand forecast for 2026 does not currently reflect any investment demand increase from GFEX. Even without considering the potential upside from GFEX's platinum and palladium futures, however, physical bar and coin investment demand in China is expected to grow for the seventh consecutive year in 2026, reaching 453 000 oz.\n\nWhat is WPIC's relationship to GFEX?\n\nStrategically, WPIC is firmly committed to the development of the platinum investment market in China, and the country offers huge potential in this regard. We are focused on building strong relationships with major organisations such as GFEX as we believe that this is the best way to nurture the growth in platinum investment product availability that is needed to meet growing investor demand. Specifically, we are highly supportive of GFEX's initiative and have had an informal advisory role in the research and development phase of the launch process, providing platinum and palladium market insights. We also assisted GFEX by enabling dialogue with relevant industrial third parties and by inviting the exchange to participate in London Platinum Week in 2024, and Shanghai Platinum Week every year since 2023.\n\nHas the recent change in VAT rules on platinum in China affected the launch?\n\nThe impact of the new policy is complex and far reaching, but a key impact is that it creates a level playing field between the Shanghai Gold Exchange and other trading platforms, including GFEX. In our view, it will improve market efficiencies in China, which we believe is supportive of GFEX's platinum futures contracts.\n\nWPIC MEMBERS\n\nMembers of WPIC include pre-production members such as Bravo Mining Corporation and Podium Minerals, as well as the major South African PGM mining companies such as Implats, Northam Platinum, Sedibelo Platinum, Tharisa and Valterra Platinum.\n\nBravo, a Canada- and Brazil-based mineral exploration and development company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the OTCQX, is focused on the exploration and potential development of its 100%-owned, multimillion-ounce Luanga palladium, platinum, rhodium, gold, nickel project in the Caraj\u00e1s Mineral Province, Par\u00e1 state, Brazil.\n\nPodium, a Western Australian PGM exploration and development company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, is developing the five-element Parks Reef PGM Project, which contains Australia's largest platinum resource.",

      "title": "APEC And China's Leadership In Regional Sustainability | Independent Newspaper Nigeria",
      "body": "For the past two decades, APEC, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, has been reshaping the Asia-Pacific's approach to growth. Since the 2011 Honolulu Leaders' Declaration, APEC has placed \"green growth\" at the heart of its agenda, showing progress and environmental sustainability don't have to be at odds.\n\nEnergy lies at the very core of this transformation. As the foundation of both economic expansion and environmental protection, improving energy efficiency has become central APEC's collective commitments.\n\nIn 2011, APEC economies agreed to reduce energy intensity, the amount of energy used per unit of GDP, to 45% by 2035, compared with 2005 levels.\n\nProgress has been strong. According to the APEC Energy Review 2025, the region is on track to meet the 45% target by 2032, three years ahead of schedule. Today, APEC economies account for about 56% of global energy demand and 60% of CO\u2082 emissions. Despite challenges such as the post-pandemic rebound in energy use and global market disruptions, the region's collective efforts have already avoided billions of tons of emissions and saved trillions of dollars in energy costs.\n\nChina's green transition has made it a major force within APEC's broader sustainability story. According to the State Council of China, the country's energy consumption per unit of GDP dropped by 11.6% between 2021 and 2024, a reduction equivalent to around 1.1 billion tonnes of CO2, or nearly half the European Union's annual emissions.\n\nAlongside industrial efficiency, natural ecosystems are pulling their weight too. Data from the National Forestry and Grassland Administration show that China's stock volume has exceeded 20 billion cubic meters. These natural carbon sinks absorb about 1.2 billion tonnes of CO\u2082 each year, equals around 3% of global emissions.\n\nBuilding on these twin tracks of efficiency and ecosystem restoration, China is also exploring next-generation clean energy technologies to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nOne example is green hydrogen. China has hit a major milestone in green hydrogen, launching its first large-scale project with over 10,000 tonnes of annual output. This aligns with APEC's identification last year of green hydrogen as a potential key driver of the region's low-carbon transition.\n\nSince June 2023, a green hydrogen plant in Aksu Prefecture in Xinjiang, began operations. To date, it has produced more than 14,900 tonnes of hydrogen, and the project is expected to cut about 485,000 tonnes of CO\u2082 emissions each year.\n\nTogether with nationwide efforts to improve energy efficiency and restore ecosystems, such advances demonstrate China's continued progress toward a green transition and serve as a model for other APEC economies exploring renewable solutions.\n\nChina's leadership in clean energy extends far beyond its borders. From cross-border hydropower grids to innovative energy storage projects, its efforts are helping drive sustainable development across the Asia-Pacific.\n\nChina has a long history of hydropower development, generating approximately 1,226 terawatt-hours of hydroelectric power in 2023. According to International Banker, a UK-based financial and business publication, this output is roughly three times that of either Brazil or Canada individually, making China the world's largest producer of hydropower.\n\nBuilding on this leadership, China has established power grid interconnections with countries in the Lancang-Mekong region, including Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia. Around 90% of the electricity transmitted through these grids comes from renewable sources, primarily hydropower. The result: greater energy security, lower fossil fuel reliance, and a smaller carbon footprint across borders.\n\nChina's influence also extends to regional clean energy storage. In 2022, Singapore commissioned a large-scale energy storage system on Jurong Island, constructed by Chinese companies.\n\nCompleted three years ahead of Singapore's 2025 target of 200 megawatts of storage capacity, the project enhances grid stability and the reliability of renewable energy supply. During cloudy or rainy conditions, the system releases stored electricity to stabilize fluctuations in the grid, and its lithium iron phosphate batteries ensure a safe, environmentally friendly solution suitable for Singapore's dense urban environment.\n\nGreen cooperation among APEC economies has proven that economic growth and sustainability don't have to pull in opposite directions. China's efforts in green transition, along with its support for neighboring countries, show how one nation's progress can drive broader regional sustainability. By combining domestic achievements with regional cooperation, these efforts pave the way for a low-carbon, resilient, and prosperous Asia-Pacific.\n\nAs APEC economies continue to collaborate on clean energy, technology, and innovation, they're charting into a better future where growth truly works with the planet, not against it.",

      "title": "From HyHaul To China: Why Hydrogen Transport Keeps Losing",
      "body": "HyHaul was supposed to be a proof point. It was framed as the UK's first serious hydrogen freight corridor, backed by public money, supported by major industrial partners, and aligned with national decarbonization narratives. It had all the visible ingredients of credibility: government grants, memoranda of understanding, press releases, and carefully staged announcements about future hydrogen refueling stations and fuel cell trucks.\n\nWhat it never had was a closed commercial loop. Fleet operators did not sign binding commitments at scale. Refueling stations did not reach final investment decisions. Vehicles remained promised rather than delivered. By late 2025, HyHaul did not collapse in a dramatic way. It simply stopped. The program was dropped, the funding withdrawn, and the corridor quietly abandoned. That outcome matters not because HyHaul failed, but because it failed in exactly the way dozens of similar hydrogen transportation efforts have failed before it.\n\nHyHaul is best understood not as a unique disappointment, but as the most recent data point in a long-running accounting exercise. Over the past year, I have been tracking 171 firms and projects that positioned hydrogen as a viable transportation solution across trucks, buses, trains, ships, aircraft, construction equipment, and light vehicles. The criteria are simple. If hydrogen was proposed as a meaningful propulsion or fuel solution for transport, it goes on the list. If that effort is later abandoned, cancelled, shelved by a parent company, or ends in bankruptcy, it is marked accordingly. I'm stringent about the quality of the data. The organization had to be working on hydrogen for transportation in 2025, meaning all the ones that went bankrupt or pivoted earlier are missing. There has to be a public announcement of pivoting or failure, or two years passing with no further announcements. That means the list of above is undoubtedly being far too generous to hydrogen for transportation, and it's still damning.\n\nMany of the ones that are left are in serious financial distress. For example, Plug Power and Fuel Cell Energy are burning money at a rate that gives them months left afloat, and both did reverse stock splits to keep them on the stock market. The space is awash in red ink and investor losses.\n\nSince I last updated the data a month or so ago, several additional firms have either exited hydrogen transportation entirely or ceased operations, typical year end house cleaning in the business world. That pushes the cumulative attrition rate to 36%. That figure is not speculative. It reflects projects that no longer exist, companies that no longer operate, and transport strategies that have been explicitly or implicitly abandoned. It means people out of work, often people who had devoted their careers to hydrogen as an energy carrier. Some failed quickly and visibly. Others faded over several years after failing to convert pilot projects into repeatable deployments. The pattern is consistent across regions and transport modes. Hydrogen transportation initiatives rarely fail because the technology does not function at all. They fail because functioning is not the same as being competitive, financeable, or scalable.\n\nThe only good news out of this tale of bad strategy, lost governmental money, and wasted time is that many skilled and competent resources who now understand transportation, energy, and regulation are on the market. They are available for real transportation projects that have real fiscal and climate benefits instead of being stuck in the dead end working on thing that never stood a chance. Many of them are undoubtedly being picked up by firms doing battery-electric transportation, as they have useful skills and context, they were just stuck in an organization that couldn't make them usefully productive.\n\nThe failure modes themselves are revealing. Some companies run out of cash and enter insolvency proceedings. Others survive as legal entities while their hydrogen transport ambitions are quietly removed from strategic plans. In several cases, parent companies simply drop the hydrogen mobility program and redirect capital elsewhere without formally shutting down the subsidiary. This quiet shelving is common in infrastructure and energy transitions, where reputational risk is managed by avoiding explicit admissions of failure. HyHaul fits squarely into this category. It was not restructured, sold, or pivoted into a new line of business. The hydrogen road transport effort was turned off.\n\nAcross these cases, the underlying causes repeat. Hydrogen vehicles require expensive fueling infrastructure that cannot be justified without guaranteed throughput. Fleet operators will not commit without reliable infrastructure and predictable fuel pricing. Infrastructure investors will not build without fleet commitments. This circular dependency is not theoretical. It shows up in project after project. Public subsidies can delay the reckoning, but they cannot remove it. When grant milestones require binding commercial commitments, most hydrogen transport projects fail to meet them.\n\nAnother recurring feature is the assumption that hydrogen is necessary because batteries cannot meet the operational requirements of certain transport segments. This claim has been made for buses, long haul trucks, refuse vehicles, port equipment, trains, and even regional aircraft. In each case, the justification rests on range, refueling time, weight, or duty cycle. In each case, battery-electric alternatives have progressed faster than expected, steadily eroding the original rationale for hydrogen.\n\nChina's heavy truck market provides the clearest recent example. China is not a niche testbed. It is the world's largest commercial vehicle market, operating at scale under competitive pressures that quickly expose weak business cases. In 2025, battery-electric heavy truck sales surged, expanding into applications that were previously assumed to be out of reach. Hydrogen fuel cell truck sales, already low, declined further. This occurred despite continued policy support and years of pilot programs. The result was not ambiguous. Where operators were free to choose, battery-electric trucks won on cost, reliability, infrastructure availability, and operational simplicity.\n\nMy analysis of China's heavy truck market documents this shift clearly. Battery-electric trucks displaced diesel in urban freight, drayage, mining, and increasingly in regional haul. Charging infrastructure and battery swapping expanded alongside grid upgrades that were already underway for industrial electrification. Hydrogen trucks, by contrast, remained dependent on bespoke refueling stations, high fuel costs, and complex supply chains. The argument that hydrogen was needed because batteries would not cut it did not survive exposure to a real market with real buyers.\n\nThis pattern extends beyond China. In Europe, battery-electric buses have scaled while hydrogen bus deployments remain limited and subsidy dependent. In North America, battery-electric delivery vans and refuse trucks have expanded while hydrogen alternatives struggle to move beyond demonstration fleets. Even in rail, where hydrogen was promoted as a replacement for diesel on non-electrified lines, battery trains are increasingly competitive for the same routes. The same is true for ferries, where 2,100 passenger battery-electric ferries are on order, dozens or low hundreds of battery-electric ferries are in operation and a sole hydrogen ferry, Norway's MF Hydra, is afloat. The common thread is not ideology. It is incremental improvement in batteries, power electronics, and charging systems that compound year after year.\n\nHydrogen's disadvantages in transportation are structural. Producing hydrogen consumes electricity. Compressing or liquefying it consumes more. Transporting and dispensing it consumes still more. Each step adds cost, complexity, and points of failure. Battery-electric systems avoid most of these steps by using electricity directly. That efficiency advantage translates into lower operating costs and simpler infrastructure. No amount of branding or pilot projects changes the physics.\n\nAnother factor undermining hydrogen's case in transportation is its propensity to leak and the climate consequences of those leaks. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule, diffusing easily through seals, valves, fittings, and materials that are adequate for natural gas or diesel. Leakage rates are not theoretical. They are observed across production, compression, transport, storage, and refueling, especially in distributed systems like vehicle fueling networks. Once released, hydrogen does not act as a greenhouse gas directly, but it has a potent indirect warming effect. Atmospheric hydrogen increases the lifetime of methane by consuming hydroxyl radicals, and it contributes to the formation of tropospheric ozone.\n\nPeer reviewed research has shown that on a 20-year timeframe, leaked hydrogen has a climate impact in the range of 33 to 37 times that of carbon dioxide. This means hydrogen transportation systems must achieve low leakage across complex, decentralized infrastructure to break even on climate claims. Battery-electric systems avoid this risk entirely by keeping energy in the form of electrons rather than a highly diffusive gas, removing an entire category of emissions that hydrogen transport struggles to control in practice.\n\nThis does not mean hydrogen has no role in the decarbonization transition. Industrial feedstocks and chemical processes that need hydrogen because of its specific chemical characteristics, and right now that's all coming from fossil hydrogen with high greenhouse gas emissions. Job one is replacing black and gray hydrogen, not finding new use cases for hydrogen. What it does mean is that transportation has consistently failed to justify hydrogen outside of rockets going into orbit (and even there the industry is moving to methane). The attrition rate across hydrogen transport firms reflects this reality. When pilot funding ends and commercial discipline begins, most projects do not proceed.\n\nHyHaul's story matters because it was not marginal. It was well connected, well funded by public standards, and well aligned with policy narratives. Its failure to launch should be taken seriously. It adds to a growing body of evidence that hydrogen transportation initiatives are not being overtaken by better hydrogen projects, but by battery-electric systems that keep expanding into territory that was supposed to remain inaccessible.\n\nTracking these outcomes is not about scoring points, although I will freely admit to a sense of schadenfreude simply because I've been pointing out hydrogen's shortcomings for transportation for years. It is about learning from repeated market signals. When 36% of tracked firms exit or abandon a strategy, the appropriate response is not to double down on the same assumptions. It is to reassess where public money, corporate capital, and engineering effort are best applied. The energy transition will not be won by preserving narratives. It will be shaped by technologies that continue to deliver when subsidies fade and markets decide.",

      "title": "China's Hydrogen Industry - Opportunities for Foreign Investors",
      "body": "China's hydrogen industry is poised for major growth as the country intensifies the development of infrastructure and promotes end-use applications as a low-carbon fuel. In its current form, however, the industry is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, and the green hydrogen segment is still in its infancy. These realities present both exciting opportunities for early investments and intrinsic early-mover risks, as infrastructure and value chains remain immature and future demand growth is uncertain. Foreign investors can seek to capitalize on the country's bet on the emerging fuel source by selecting strategic and limited entry points and exploring the scope of possibilities.\n\nChina is doubling down on its bet on hydrogen as a potentially revolutionary clean energy source. Viewed as a means of diversifying the country's energy mix and bolstering energy security, the clean-burning fuel may also prove key to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors such as transportation, steel, and chemicals. But as in the rest of the world, current production and utilization of hydrogen remain closely tied to the petrochemicals and coal industries. Most hydrogen is currently produced from fossil fuels, and its use is still concentrated in refinery, petrochemicals, and other energy-intensive industrial processes.\n\nChina's green hydrogen industry is still in its infancy, both in terms of large-scale production and diversified end-use applications. Due to its significant potential as a low-carbon energy source, the sector nonetheless enjoys strong government attention and support. It has been outlined as one of six \"future industries\" (along with nuclear fusion energy) of focus for the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026 to 2030). This creates meaningful potential for future technological development, expanded adoption, and access to government incentives as the sector grows.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, opportunities for foreign investment emerge across multiple segments of the hydrogen value chain. Potential entry points range from production technologies and equipment to storage and transport solutions, to downstream applications in transportation, industrial heating, and chemical processing. These openings reflect both the scale of China's future hydrogen ambitions and the ongoing need for advanced technologies, high-quality equipment, and operational expertise as the industry evolves.\n\nChina is the world's leading producer of hydrogen. In 2024, total hydrogen output grew 3.5 percent year-on-year to 36.5 million metric tons, according to the National Energy Administration (NEA), accounting for over a third of global production.\n\nAs is the case worldwide, China's hydrogen production is primarily based on the coal and petrochemical industries. The majority of hydrogen in China is the so-called \"black\" or \"brown\" hydrogen, which comes from coal, a high-emitting source most commonly produced through the process of gasification. According to the NEA, around 56 percent of China's total hydrogen production came from coal and 21 percent from natural gas. A further 21 percent was produced as an industry by-product (usually from the petrochemical industry). Only around 1 percent was produced through electrolysis, the process of using electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, which, if produced using renewable energy sources, is the cleanest form of hydrogen.\n\nThis proportion aligns with global production trends. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), less than 1 percent of global hydrogen production in 2024 came from low-emissions sources.\n\nHydrogen production in China is primarily concentrated in the north and northwest, with the provinces of Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Shanxi together accounting for 45 percent of total output in 2024.\n\nAccording to NEA data, in 2024, over half of China's hydrogen - a combined 53 percent - was used in the methanol and ammonia synthesis industries, while the refinery industry consumed 16 percent and the coal chemical industry 11 percent. The remaining 20 percent was utilized in industries such as transportation, heating, and metallurgy.\n\nAs with production, hydrogen consumption is mainly concentrated in traditional heavy industrial provinces such as Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Shanxi.\n\nWhile green hydrogen accounts for just a small proportion of China's overall hydrogen production, the country is expanding output capacity, in particular in areas with rich renewable energy resources.\n\nAccording to the NEA, there were over 600 planned renewable energy hydrogen electrolysis projects at the end of 2024, of which 94 had been completed, and a further 83 were under construction. The current output of the completed green hydrogen projects at the end of 2024 was 125,000 tonnes per year. Northern and northwestern China account for around 45 percent and 44 percent of this capacity, respectively, driven by these regions' strong traditional industrial bases and rich renewable resources.\n\n2024 alone saw the completion of 35 new green hydrogen products with a combined output capacity of 48,000 tonnes per year. This was an increase of 62 percent in newly added capacity from the previous year. The main downstream uses of this green hydrogen were transport, oil refinery, and ammonia and methanol synthesis, as well as metallurgy, heating, power generation, energy storage, and scientific research.\n\nChina's total green hydrogen capacity may see yet another increase in 2025, with the government actively funding a number of green hydrogen demonstration projects. In April 2025, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) included nine green hydrogen projects in a list of advanced green and low-carbon technology demonstration projects, which will receive government investment. The projects, which cover the production, storage, and transmission of green hydrogen, among other processes, are primarily located in Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Jiangsu, Tianjin, and Xinjiang.\n\nAccording to a recent report from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), the combined capacity of the electrolyzers of these nine projects is 5.9GW - seven times the capacity of the green hydrogen projects included on the 2024 list.\n\nAs in the rest of the world, China's hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV) industry is still in its infancy. According to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) cited by the media, between 2015 and 2024, a total of 24,042 FCVs had been produced in China and 23,501 sold. In 2024, only 5,548 FCVs were manufactured, a year-on-year decline of 10.4 percent. FCV sales were similarly low, with just 5,405 sold, falling 12.6 percent from 2023.\n\nThe industry appears to have fared no better in 2025; CAAM data shows that in the first six months of the year, only 1,364 hydrogen FCVs were produced, a drop of 47.2 percent year-on-year, and only 1,373 were sold, down 46.8 percent year-on-year.\n\nAs the data shows, the industry has not taken off as quickly as hoped. A key hydrogen development plan released by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in 2022 targeted for China to have a fleet of around 50,000 hydrogen FCVs by 2025 - a figure it appears unlikely to reach. The slow uptake is due in part to the limited production and supportive infrastructure, such as refueling stations, which hamper widespread production and adoption. According to the NEA, there were around 540 hydrogen refueling stations at the end of 2024.\n\nThe NEA nonetheless notes key technological breakthroughs in the deployment of hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels for transport in recent years. These include a long-haul hydrogen-powered logistics trial on the Beijing-Shanghai expressway, the rollout of a 2,400-kW hydrogen-powered train, and the first flight of a prototype light hydrogen-combustion aircraft. Progress has also extended to maritime applications, with the methanol-fueled vessel Guoneng Yangtze 01 entering commercial operations, a 5,500-horsepower ammonia-fueled tugboat completing marine ammonia bunkering, and a large methanol-powered container ship carrying out ship-to-ship refueling.\n\nIn 2022, the NDRC released the Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for the Hydrogen Energy Industry (2021-2035) (the \"2021 to 2030 Development Plan), which sets targets and provides policy guidance for the industry's development.\n\nThis plan called hydrogen energy \"an important component of the future national energy system\" and a \"crucial conveyor for achieving the green and low-carbon transition in energy end uses\", underscoring how the government views the technology as an important tool for both national energy security and decarbonization.\n\nOver the past few years, the Chinese government has elevated the hydrogen industry as one of the \"future industries\" with significant potential for expansion and application. The 14th Five-Year Plan (the national development plan for the period from 2021 to 2025) called for the government to \"organize and implement future industry incubation and acceleration programs, and plan and deploy a number of future industries\", which included hydrogen energy and energy storage.\n\nThe sector was also mentioned in the proposals for the 15th Five-Year Plan, released at the end of October 2025, which acts as the blueprint for the finalized plan, which will be implemented in 2026. It specifically calls for \"proactively planning for future industries, exploring a variety of technological routes, typical application scenarios, feasible business models, and market regulatory rules to promote [...] hydrogen energy\", among other emerging sectors, and to \"innovate regulatory methods, develop venture capital, and establish mechanisms for increasing investment and sharing risks in [these] future industries\".\n\nThe 2021 to 2030 Development Plan sets a series of five-, 10-, and 15-year goals for the development of hydrogen production and adoption. However, it only sets numerical targets for 2025, namely:\n\nBy 2030, China will strive to have formed \"a relatively complete hydrogen energy industry technology innovation system and clean energy hydrogen production and supply system, with a rational and orderly industrial layout. Renewable energy hydrogen production will be widely applied, strongly supporting the achievement of the [2030] carbon peak target\".\n\nBy 2035, \"a hydrogen energy industry system will be formed\", supporting a diversified hydrogen energy application ecosystem that covers transportation, energy storage, and industry. Additionally, the proportion of hydrogen from renewable energy sources in final energy consumption will have \"increased significantly\" and will play \"an important supporting role in the green transformation and development of energy\".\n\nAt the end of 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) released the Implementation Plan for Accelerating the Application of Clean and Low-Carbon Hydrogen in Industrial Sectors (the \"Green Hydrogen Implementation Plan\"), which builds on the 2021 to 2030 Development Plan to set more granular targets and policy outlines for the production and utilization of green hydrogen.\n\nThe Green Hydrogen Implementation Plan's core aim is to achieve significant progress in \"supporting equipment and promoting technologies for clean and low-carbon hydrogen applications in the industrial sector\" by the year 2027. It highlights key industries for application, including metallurgy, synthetic ammonia, synthetic methanol, and oil refinery. It also calls for deploying demonstration applications in fields such as industrial green microgrids, shipping, aviation, and rail transportation, and to create commercial application models for hydrogen energy in transportation, power generation, and energy storage.\n\nFor foreign investors, China's hydrogen sector offers a combination of challenges and opportunities. While it is a nascent industry with considerable room for growth, many viable applications and benefits of the technology have already been proven across multiple fields. The sector also has strong policy backing and an expectation of rising demand as technologies mature and costs decline. At the same time, early movers face clear risks, from underdeveloped infrastructure and evolving standards to potential setbacks associated with the commercialization of emerging technologies.\n\nDespite these challenges, the outlook of China's hydrogen industry is compelling, and the Chinese government continues to spotlight a number of hydrogen-related segments as priority areas for development. Additionally, the 2022 edition of the Catalogue of Encouraged Industries for Foreign Investment (the \"2022 FI Encouraged Catalogue\") includes several fields related to hydrogen energy, including FCVs, equipment manufacturing, and technology R&D.\n\nEquipment manufacturing remains a strong area of opportunity for foreign investors, particularly as China works to build out the full hydrogen value chain. The 2022 FI Encouraged Catalogue includes green hydrogen production technologies, such as hydrogen from chemical by-products, biological hydrogen production, and renewable-energy-based electrolysis, as well as hydrogen storage, transportation, and liquefaction. This reflects broad openness to foreign firms engaged in the core technologies required to produce and handle hydrogen at scale.\n\nForeign companies with advanced manufacturing expertise and proprietary technologies can find demand across multiple equipment categories. These include electrolyzers, membrane and catalyst materials, compressors, high-pressure storage systems, liquid hydrogen equipment, and purification and transport systems.\n\nIn addition, opportunities exist in upstream technology development. As China seeks to expand green hydrogen production and improve the performance of production and storage systems, companies offering innovations in electrolysis efficiency, materials science, and modular system design are well-positioned to collaborate with local partners or establish localized manufacturing. For foreign investors, this segment offers a pathway to participate in China's emerging hydrogen ecosystem while contributing high-value technologies and capabilities.\n\nOne tangible opportunity for foreign investors in the hydrogen industry is the development of hydrogen FCVs. Although the industry has faced setbacks in recent years, continuous policy support means there is still a strong possibility for the market's future growth.\n\nChina has identified hydrogen-powered transportation as a strategic growth area, offering both policy support and a clear roadmap for industry development. The 2022 FI Encouraged Catalogue explicitly includes several activities related to FCVs. These include the design and R&D of hydrogen fuel cell power systems, the construction and operation of hydrogen refueling stations, and the development, manufacturing, and operation of new energy storage equipment, including hydrogen storage.\n\nPolicy directives outlined in the Green Hydrogen Implementation Plan further reinforce these opportunities. The plan emphasizes technological innovation in fuel cells and hydrogen storage, encouraging the development of high-power, efficient, and long-life fuel cells, high-efficiency hydrogen or ammonia internal combustion engines, and high-pressure, high-density onboard hydrogen storage systems.\n\nDemonstration projects are also being encouraged to integrate renewable hydrogen and high-quality industrial by-product hydrogen, supporting distributed hydrogen production and refueling stations. Simultaneously, the scale-up of FCV use in industrial clusters, such as industrial parks, logistics hubs, ports, and mines, is a priority, creating opportunities for foreign companies to supply vehicles, refueling infrastructure, fleet management systems, and operational expertise. The government also supports the creation of \"district-to-district\" hydrogen energy logistics corridors and city clusters for fuel cell vehicle demonstrations, while initiatives such as \"Hydrogen for All\" promote applications across highways, ports, industrial zones, and commercial equipment, further opening avenues for technology deployment and commercialization.\n\nInvestors should nonetheless be aware of the risks associated with entering an immature industry. China's hydrogen FCV industry has stagnated, despite government support for pilot projects. The sector continues to suffer from high costs for fuel cells and refueling stations, the limited number and inconvenient locations of refueling stations, and the high price of hydrogen due to limited supply.\n\nFor this reason, foreign investors should approach the market with caution, prioritizing cost reduction strategies, such as utilizing lower-cost black or brown hydrogen in the short term and focusing initially on applications that may be easier to commercialize, such as trucks and freight transport, rather than passenger vehicles. Investors may also look at the construction and operation of hydrogen fueling stations, as well as R&D and manufacturing of hydrogen FCV components such as hydrogen circulation pumps, hydrogen ejectors, 70MPa hydrogen cylinders, and vehicle-mounted hydrogen concentration sensors, all of which are listed in the 2022 FI Encouraged Catalog.\n\nAt the same time, policy incentives will remain critical to industry growth, making it essential for investors to closely monitor evolving government support and align market entry or expansion plans accordingly.\n\nChina is placing strong emphasis on replacing fossil-fuel-based hydrogen with cleaner alternatives across its industrial system, creating a range of opportunities for foreign technology providers and project developers.\n\nThe Green Hydrogen Implementation Plan promotes several areas for development in this field. First, major energy- and materials-intensive sectors, such as refining, petrochemicals, coal chemicals, non-ferrous metals, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, are being encouraged to substitute conventional fossil-derived hydrogen with clean or low-carbon hydrogen. This shift is expected to generate demand for advanced electrolysis technologies, hydrogen purification systems, and equipment that can be integrated into existing production lines.\n\nSecond, authorities are prioritizing the development of low-cost renewable-energy-based hydrogen production. This includes advancing \"solar + storage\" solutions, promoting integrated \"hydrogen production + hydrogen use\" projects in regions rich in wind and solar resources, and supporting off-grid or weak-grid hydrogen production models. These initiatives open space for foreign firms with expertise in renewable integration, energy storage, and high-efficiency power electronics.\n\nThe plan also highlights frontier areas such as coupling industrial waste heat with high-temperature electrolysis and leveraging offshore wind for hydrogen production. In addition, China is encouraging the scaled-up purification of industrial by-product hydrogen and the installation of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) systems at fossil-based hydrogen facilities, creating further opportunities for specialized equipment and engineering services.\n\nChina's hydrogen industry presents a complex but promising landscape for foreign investors. On the demand side, hydrogen's potential role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors positions it as a strategic future energy source with significant long-term growth prospects. This potential is further reinforced by strong government backing, with hydrogen repeatedly identified as a priority emerging industry and a focus of national development planning. These factors create a potentially favorable environment for foreign participation across multiple segments of the value chain.\n\nAt the same time, the industry's immaturity poses inherent risks. Production, infrastructure, and end-use applications are still developing, and recent years have shown that market growth can be slower and more uneven than expected. For this reason, investors should adopt a cautious and selective approach, targeting segments where early commercial opportunities exist, limiting exposure in areas facing high uncertainty, and aligning closely with evolving policy incentives.",

      "body": "For the last few years, the screen has been winning.\n\nWe have been living in a \"Zero Marginal Cost\" fantasy...\n\nWe convinced ourselves that adding another million users to ChatGPT was free. That scaling a startup was just a matter of writing better code. That \"The Cloud\" was an infinite, weightless place where business happened by magic.\n\nBut today, S&P Global Energy dropped a bucket of ice water on that fever dream.\n\nI've spent the morning reading through their new Horizons Top Trends 2026 forecast. It's dense. It's technical. It's written in the polite, measured language of analysts who don't like to shout. But if you translate the data into plain English, they are shouting.\n\nThe bottleneck isn't the code anymore. It's the copper. It's the transformers. It's the sheer, raw wattage required to keep the simulation running. And right now? We don't have enough of it.\n\nLet's look at the raw numbers, because they are wild.\n\nIt is easy to glaze over a number like that. We hear stats about \"energy consumption\" all the time. But context is everything.\n\nLast year, the IEA warned we might hit 1,000 TWh in 2026...\n\nS&P has looked at the trajectory of AI adoption and effectively doubled that forecast.\n\nTo put that 2,200 TWh figure in perspective: that is roughly the total electricity consumption of India.\n\nBut the \"India\" comparison actually undersells the severity of the problem.\n\nA country's energy demand breathes. It fluctuates. People turn off lights... factories shut down for the night. The load varies.\n\nAI demand is different. It is a flat line of maximum intensity. It is relentless, baseload hunger.\n\nData centers don't sleep, they don't take holidays, and they don't throttle down.\n\nWe are attempting to bolt a rigid, massive, always-on load onto a global grid that was designed for the variable rhythms of the 20th century. And we are trying to do it while 38% of the companies driving this demand have no credible plan to get to net zero.\n\nWe are pouring $500 billion in capital expenditure into U.S. data centers for 2026 alone. That is half a trillion dollars going into the \"engine\" of the economy, while the \"fuel lines\" are rusted through.\n\nWe are building the most advanced computing infrastructure in human history, and we are expecting it to run on transmission maps drawn up during the Nixon administration.\n\nFor decades, the electrical grid was the \"boring\" part of the energy transition. It was wires and poles. It was a utility stock you bought for the dividend.\n\nThat era is dead. The grid is now the single biggest bottleneck to the digital economy, and S&P has upgraded grid modernization from a \"utility issue\" to a \"national competitiveness issue.\"\n\nThe report paints a bleak picture of our current infrastructure:\n\nBut \"modernization\" doesn't just mean hanging more copper wire. The report hints at a massive technological overhaul required to manage this new load.\n\nTo handle the chaotic influx of renewables and the massive, steady draw of AI, the grid needs a brain transplant. We are moving toward Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Virtual Power Plants (VVPs)...systems that aggregate thousands of small batteries and solar panels to act like one giant power plant.\n\nWe are seeing the necessity for Grid-Forming Inverters.\n\nIn the old days, heavy spinning turbines (coal, gas, nuclear) provided the physical inertia to keep the grid frequency stable. Solar panels don't spin. As we retire the turbines, we lose that stability. We now need advanced inverters that can synthetically replicate that inertia. Without them, the grid becomes brittle, prone to blackouts the moment a cloud passes over a solar farm.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of cybersecurity.\n\nAs we digitize the grid with smart meters and AI balancing, we expand the attack surface. A grid that runs on software is a grid that can be hacked. The report emphasizes \"energy security,\" and in 2026, security means ensuring a rogue actor can't turn off the lights in Northern Virginia with a keystroke.\n\nIf the physical grid is changing, the financial plumbing is changing even faster.\n\nFor the last decade, Big Tech bought clean energy through simple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Google would sign a contract to buy wind power from a farm in Iowa for 10 years at a fixed price. Simple. Clean.\n\nS&P says that model is breaking.\n\n\"Flexible Power Purchase Agreements become the new standard,\" the report notes.\n\nWhy? Because the market is getting violent.\n\nAs we flood the grid with solar, we are seeing more instances of negative pricing...moments where there is so much power at noon that generators literally pay the grid to take it. But at 8 PM? Prices spike.\n\nA simple \"pay-as-produced\" PPA doesn't work in a market where the price of power fluctuates between -$20 and +$500 in a single day.\n\nWe are seeing the rise of Hybrid PPAs and 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) contracts.\n\nThese are complex financial structures that bundle solar (for the day), wind (for the night), and storage (for the gaps) to guarantee a flat, steady profile.\n\nIt is no longer enough to just \"buy green.\" You have to buy reliability.\n\nThis volatility is driving a massive boom in storage. You can't run a data center on intermittent power. You need a buffer.\n\nBut for the hyperscalers...Amazon, Microsoft, Google...batteries aren't enough. They are starting to bypass the grid entirely.\n\nIf the utility tells you it takes five years to get a hookup...you build your own power plant.\n\nWe are talking about data centers colocating with existing nuclear plants (like the Three Mile Island deal) or exploring small modular reactors (SMRs) and solid oxide fuel cells on campus.\n\nBig Tech is becoming an electric utility with a side hustle in software.\n\nWhile the West scrambles to upgrade its transformers and figure out PPAs, China is pivoting. And this might be the most critical geopolitical signal in the entire report.\n\nFor the first time ever, S&P expects global solar installations to decline in 2026.\n\nWhy? Because China is tapping the brakes. They are shifting from guaranteed pricing to competitive bidding. They are signaling that the \"growth at all costs\" phase for solar is over. They have won that war. They own the supply chain.\n\nNow, they are moving to the next battlefield: green hydrogen.\n\nChina doesn't just want to sell us the infrastructure anymore. They want to sell us the fuel too. They are positioning themselves to be the Saudi Arabia of the green energy era.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting trend in the report is the return of the state.\n\nFor forty years, the western energy model was \"deregulation.\" Let the market decide.\n\nThat's quietly disappearing. S&P highlights a move toward a \"more interventionist industrial strategy\" in the U.S. The report explicitly mentions \"greater government involvement through equity stakes.\"\n\nThis is the Sovereign Equity Model I talked about in a previous piece.\n\nThe challenges of the transition...grid modernization, nuclear power, critical minerals...are too capital-intensive and too risky for the private market to handle alone.\n\nWe are moving into an era where the government is a regulator...and shareholder.\n\nThis is the weaponization of climate policy.\n\nSo, how do you navigate a world where the digital economy is writing checks the physical grid can't cash?\n\nThe S&P report makes it clear:\n\n\"Energy expansion and sustainability are not parallel ambitions, but intertwined imperatives.\"\n\nIf you are looking at an energy project, a data center REIT, or a tech major, you cannot evaluate them based on their press releases. You need to audit their physical reality. Standard ESG metrics won't help you here; they measure intent. We need to measure capacity.\n\nStop looking at \"Net Zero by 2030\" pledges and start looking at the electrons. We are moving from an era of \"Paper Carbon\" to \"Real Power.\"\n\nReal estate agents say \"Location, Location, Location.\" Energy investors need to say \"Queue, Queue, Queue.\"\n\nIn an interventionist era, you do not want to fight the state. You want to be the state's partner.\n\nOnce you have filtered the market through this lens...separating the accounting tricks from the thermodynamic realities...you're left with a very short list of investable themes. And they fall into three specific portfolios.\n\nIf you accept the thesis that 2026 is the year physics punches back, then your entire investment logic has to flip.\n\nYou stop looking at the companies burning the energy (the tech giants) and you start looking at the companies building the fireplace.\n\nS&P's data points to three specific areas where capital has no choice but to flow.\n\nThis is the unsexy stuff. This is the portfolio for the person who sees that \u20ac584 billion grid infrastructure gap in Europe and sees a massive, multi-year order book.\n\nFor the last twenty years, we treated the grid like a static asset. We assumed the wires would just... work. But now, we are trying to shove gigawatts of wind power from the North Sea down to the data centers in Frankfurt, and we are realizing the pipes are too small.\n\nWe aren't just replacing old lines; we are building high-tech energy superhighways.\n\nThe winners here are the industrial heavyweights. You have cable giants like Prysmian and Nexans, whose factories are reportedly booked out for years building the subsea interconnectors that tie nations together. You have the heavy electrical engineers like Siemens Energy and Hitachi Energy...the only people on earth who can build the massive transformers and switchgear capable of handling these loads.\n\nAnd in the U.S., you have the builders. Companies like Quanta Services that literally dig the ditches and string the copper. It isn't glamorous. It won't get you a keynote at CES. But in a hardware-constrained world, it is the only work that matters.\n\nIf volatility is the new standard -- if electricity prices can swing from negative to sky-high in a single afternoon -- then the market is going to pay a premium for flexibility.\n\nThis portfolio bets on the \"brain\" and the \"buffer\" of the grid.\n\nWe are flooding the system with dumb, weather-dependent power. Solar panels go dark when clouds roll in. Wind turbines stop when the air settles. To keep a data center running through that chaos, you need smart, responsive assets.\n\nThe obvious play here is the integrators like Fluence and Tesla (Megapack), who are deploying utility-scale batteries at a frantic pace. But the real \"alpha\" might be in the software layer.\n\nLook at companies like Stem or the internal trading desks of utilities like NextEra. These players are running \"Virtual Power Plants\"...using AI to arbitrage the grid, discharging power exactly when the price spikes. They are effectively the market makers of the electron economy, profiting from the very instability the transition creates.\n\nWhile the West fights over electrons, China is betting that the future runs on liquid fuels. This portfolio is a hedge against the physical limits of the wire.\n\nS&P makes the situation stark: China effectively owns the electrolyzer hardware market. With costs driving under $100/kW, Western manufacturers simply cannot compete on price.\n\nSo, if you believe hydrogen and green ammonia are the future, you have to look for the \"moats.\"\n\nThe opportunity likely splits into two camps.\n\nFirst, you have the \"Midstream\"...the shipping titans like Maersk or chemical handlers like Yara. They don't care who makes the machine; they get paid to move the product from the sunny deserts where it's made to the rainy cities where it's burned.\n\nSecond, you have the \"Protectionist\" plays.\n\nAs Western governments erect tariff walls to block Chinese tech, domestic manufacturers like Bloom Energy (solid oxide fuel cells) or Plug Power stand to benefit from \"Buy American\" or \"Buy European\" mandates. In this scenario, their value comes not just from their technology, but from their regulatory shield.\n\nFor the last fifteen years, Silicon Valley sold us a beautiful lie: that we could decouple growth from the physical world.\n\nWe called it the \"Zero Marginal Cost\" era. In that world, scaling was frictionless.\n\nWe convinced ourselves that the economy could float in the Cloud, untethered from the messy reality of atoms, borders, and thermodynamics.\n\nEvery new AI token generated requires a liter of water and a specific jolt of electricity. Every new data center requires a substation, a transmission line, and a government permit that takes five years to approve.\n\nThe friction is back. And it is expensive.",

      "body": "JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) - Many countries are still pursuing the development of platinum- and iridium-using green hydrogen infrastructure, including China where green hydrogen features in the latest Five-Year Plan to 2030.\n\nThe globally active Heraeus adds in its 2026 forecast just out that a return to demand growth in the hydrogen sector is anticipated, though it is not yet clear how much this will impact the iridium market, which the Hanau-based company expects to trade at between $3 800/oz and $5 150/oz in 2026.\n\nWith PGM prices being much higher than at the start of 2025, South African mining companies now have much better margins and some small projects ramping up are adding small amounts of iridium to South African output, Heraeus, which has a long-standing South African presence, points out in a release to Mining Weekly.\n\nBeing used along with iridium in green hydrogen electrolysers is ruthenium, another PGM, which is also being used in a variety of other hydrogen-related processes.\n\nWithin the push to further develop green hydrogen, China's Five-Year Plan from 2026 to 2030 seemingly includes hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles and the ruthenium price is forecast to trade between $600/oz and $975/oz in 2026.\n\nThe Heraeus report estimates that platinum is estimated to trade at between $1 300/oz and $1 800/oz in 2026, when platinum's deficit is expected to shrink.\n\nSouth Africa's platinum output is predicted by Heraeus to be somewhat higher in 2026, partly owing to the processing of work-in-progress stock that was built up during processing plant maintenance, and partly owing to the ramp-up of some new operations.\n\nThe recovery in PGM prices during 2025 improved the mining companies' margins which makes further cuts to production unlikely.\n\nSecondary recycled platinum supply is anticipated by Heraeus to rise modestly next year. In Europe, scrap autocatalyst volumes are predicted to rise with heavy-duty vehicle sales forecast to see robust growth globally, leading to greater numbers of scrapped commercial vehicles.\n\nPrimary palladium production is forecast to increase by 1% to 6.2-milion ounces next year and the rally in the PGM prices has helped to uplift secondary palladium supply.\n\nIndustrial use of rhodium is projected by Heraeus to rise modestly next year amid moderate growth in the chemical sector and marginally higher primary supply.\n\nSecondary rhodium supply is predicted by Heraeus to rise in 2026 when rhodium prices are expected to be between $6 000/oz and $9 000/oz.\n\nHeraeus, which covers the value chain from trading to refining and recycling, has extensive PGM insight.\n\nKey hydrogen systems of Heraeus group laboratories went live in China in October, where rapid growth is reported in the platinum-catalysed proton exchange membrane (PEM) green hydrogen technology that is poised to play a central decarbonisation role.\n\nThe laboratories were described as reflecting China's rapid pace of hydrogen innovation.\n\nThe cost-efficient production of green hydrogen - on the industrial scale that China can provide - will be an important contributor towards a zero-emission society, on a planet increasingly threatened by climate disruption.\n\nA return to demand growth in the hydrogen sector is anticipated by Heraeus in its 2026 forecast report, which points to some Chinese companies having developed PEM electrolysers.",
